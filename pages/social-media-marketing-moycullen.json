  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why should my Moycullen business invest in social media marketing?",
      "answer": "Social media is where your customers spend their time. It allows you to build brand awareness in Moycullen and beyond, engage directly with potential customers, showcase your products or services, drive traffic to your website or location, and generate leads and sales. It's one of the most cost-effective marketing channels with clear, measurable ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which social media platforms are best for my business?",
      "answer": "The best platforms depend on your target audience and business type. Most Moycullen businesses benefit from Facebook and Instagram for their strong local presence. LinkedIn is essential for B2B and professional services. TikTok and YouTube work well for younger audiences and video content. We'll analyze your specific situation and recommend the optimal platform mix."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should we post on social media?",
      "answer": "Posting frequency varies by platform and audience expectations. We typically recommend 4-7 posts per week on Facebook/Instagram plus daily stories, 3-5 weekly LinkedIn posts, and more frequent content on Twitter and TikTok. Quality always trumps quantity – we focus on creating engaging content that resonates with your Moycullen audience rather than posting just to post."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you manage our existing social media accounts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We can seamlessly take over your existing Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and other social accounts. We'll start with a comprehensive audit, optimize your profiles, develop an improved strategy, and implement our proven approach to enhance your Moycullen business's social media performance immediately."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your social media management services?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive services include strategy development, content planning and calendar creation, professional content production (graphics, videos, copy), scheduling and publishing, daily community management, comment and message responses, paid advertising campaign management, monthly analytics and reporting, and ongoing strategy optimization."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure social media marketing success?",
      "answer": "We track metrics that directly impact your business: engagement rates, reach and impressions, follower growth quality, website traffic from social, lead generation, conversion rates, customer acquisition cost, and ROI. Monthly reports show how your social media efforts contribute to revenue, not just vanity metrics like likes and follows."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should we budget for social media advertising?",
      "answer": "For Moycullen businesses, we typically recommend starting with €400-€1,000 per month for Facebook and Instagram ads. This allows effective testing and targeting. Larger campaigns or competitive industries may require €2,000-€6,000+ monthly. The right budget depends on your goals, industry competition, and desired results. We'll provide guidance during our consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Kraft Agency different from other social media agencies?",
      "answer": "We combine local West Galway market knowledge with AI-powered insights and creative excellence. Unlike agencies using generic templates, we develop custom strategies for each Moycullen business focused on measurable results. Our team becomes an extension of your business, representing your brand authentically while driving real business growth through social media."
