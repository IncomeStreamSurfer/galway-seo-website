  ],

  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is marketing automation and how does it work?",
      "answer": "Marketing automation uses software to automatically perform marketing tasks based on predefined triggers and rules. When someone takes an action (like visiting your website or downloading content), the system automatically responds with personalized emails, updates their profile, scores their engagement, and routes hot leads to sales – all without manual intervention."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is marketing automation suitable for small Salthill businesses?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Marketing automation is valuable for businesses of all sizes. Small businesses often benefit the most because automation allows them to compete with larger competitors by delivering sophisticated, personalized marketing at scale without requiring a large team."
    },
    {
      "question": "What results can I expect from marketing automation?",
      "answer": "Typical results include 15-40% increase in qualified leads, 10-30% improvement in conversion rates, 20-30 hours saved per week on manual tasks, and 20-50% reduction in customer acquisition costs. Most businesses achieve positive ROI within 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is AI used in marketing automation?",
      "answer": "AI powers several aspects of modern automation: predicting the best time to send emails to each person, personalizing content based on behavior patterns, scoring leads by likelihood to convert, optimizing campaign performance automatically, and identifying trends in customer behavior that inform strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can automation integrate with my existing tools?",
      "answer": "Yes! Modern automation platforms integrate with virtually every marketing and business tool including CRMs, email platforms, websites, e-commerce systems, payment processors, webinar platforms, and more. We handle all technical integration to ensure seamless data flow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't automation make my marketing feel robotic and impersonal?",
      "answer": "The opposite is true. Automation enables better personalization because you can tailor messages based on individual behavior, interests, and lifecycle stage at scale. Your customers receive timely, relevant content that feels personal – because it is personalized to them."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to set up marketing automation?",
      "answer": "Basic automation can be operational in 2-3 weeks. More comprehensive automation with multiple workflows and integrations typically takes 4-8 weeks. We focus on quick wins first, then progressively build more sophisticated automation over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What ongoing support do you provide?",
      "answer": "We provide continuous monitoring of your automation, monthly performance reporting, regular optimization based on data, technical support for any issues, strategic recommendations for improvements, and ongoing training for your team. We're your long-term automation partner."
