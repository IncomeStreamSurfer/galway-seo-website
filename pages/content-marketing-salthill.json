  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between content marketing and traditional advertising?",
      "answer": "Traditional advertising interrupts people with promotional messages. Content marketing attracts people by providing value - solving problems, answering questions, and building trust. It's more cost-effective long-term and creates lasting assets that continue to drive results, unlike ads that stop working when you stop paying."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you develop content topics that resonate with my audience?",
      "answer": "We use a combination of keyword research, competitor analysis, customer interviews, and data from your existing channels to identify topics your audience cares about. We also analyze search trends and social conversations to spot emerging opportunities relevant to your Salthill business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can content marketing work for B2B companies?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Content marketing is often even more effective for B2B companies. Longer sales cycles and complex purchasing decisions mean buyers actively research solutions. Strategic content positions you as the expert, builds trust, and nurtures prospects through the decision-making process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you maintain our brand voice in the content?",
      "answer": "We start by developing a comprehensive brand voice guide based on your input, existing materials, and brand positioning. Our writers follow this guide closely, and we submit content for your review and approval to ensure it perfectly reflects your brand personality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What content formats do you recommend?",
      "answer": "The best content mix depends on your audience and goals. Most businesses benefit from a combination of blog posts, social media content, email campaigns, and visual content like infographics or videos. We'll recommend the optimal mix based on where your audience spends time and what formats drive the best results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure content marketing success?",
      "answer": "We track a comprehensive set of metrics including organic traffic growth, keyword rankings, engagement metrics, lead generation, conversion rates, and revenue attribution. You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly how content marketing is contributing to your business goals in Salthill."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with content ideas if we run out?",
      "answer": "Running out of content ideas is never a problem when you work with us! We continuously research trends, competitor content, customer questions, and industry developments to maintain a robust content pipeline. We'll always have fresh, relevant ideas ready to go."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if we need to pause content marketing services?",
      "answer": "We offer flexible arrangements with no long-term contracts required. If you need to pause services temporarily, we can accommodate that. However, consistency is key to content marketing success - we'll work with you to find a sustainable approach that fits your budget and maintains momentum."
