  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which social media platforms should my Galway business use?",
      "answer": "It depends on your target audience and business type. B2C businesses (restaurants, retail, lifestyle) typically excel on Instagram and Facebook. B2B companies and professional services perform well on LinkedIn. We analyze your audience and recommend the optimal platform mix for your Galway business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should we post on social media?",
      "answer": "Consistency matters more than frequency. We typically recommend 3-5 posts per week on Instagram, 5-7 on Facebook, and 2-3 on LinkedIn for Galway businesses. The key is maintaining regular presence with quality content rather than overwhelming followers with quantity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you create all the content or do we need to provide it?",
      "answer": "We handle all content creation – strategy, copywriting, graphic design, and video production. While we may occasionally request photos of your products or team, we manage the creative process end-to-end so you can focus on running your Galway business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before we see results from social media marketing?",
      "answer": "Social media is a long-term strategy. You'll see engagement and follower growth within 1-3 months, but meaningful business impact (website traffic, leads, sales) typically develops over 3-6 months as we build an engaged community around your Galway brand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we invest in paid social media advertising?",
      "answer": "Yes, paid advertising accelerates growth significantly. While organic content builds long-term community, paid campaigns help you reach new Galway audiences faster, promote specific offers, and drive immediate actions like website visits or purchases. We recommend allocating 20-30% of budget to paid social."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with influencer partnerships in Galway?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We have relationships with local Galway influencers and content creators across various niches. We can identify relevant influencers for your brand, negotiate partnerships, and manage collaborations that expose your business to engaged local audiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure social media success?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics: follower growth, engagement rate, reach, impressions, website clicks, lead generation, and conversion tracking. Most importantly, we connect social media activity to real business outcomes like sales and revenue, showing true ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we have a crisis or negative comments on social media?",
      "answer": "We monitor your accounts continuously and handle community management professionally. For negative comments, we respond promptly and appropriately, turning potential crises into opportunities to demonstrate excellent customer service. We'll always consult you on sensitive issues."
