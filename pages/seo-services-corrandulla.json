  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long before my Corrandulla business sees SEO results?",
      "answer": "Most businesses see initial ranking improvements within 2-4 months, with substantial traffic growth typically occurring between 6-12 months. SEO is a medium to long-term strategy that builds momentum over time. The timeline varies based on your industry competition in Corrandulla, current website status, and keyword difficulty."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why should I invest in SEO instead of just using paid ads?",
      "answer": "Both have value! Paid ads deliver immediate traffic but require continuous spending. SEO builds long-term organic visibility that continues generating traffic without ongoing ad costs. For most Corrandulla businesses, a combination approach works best - ads for immediate results while building SEO for sustainable long-term growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you guarantee my business will rank #1 in Corrandulla?",
      "answer": "We can't ethically guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithm involves hundreds of constantly evolving factors. However, we do guarantee our commitment to proven strategies, transparent communication, and continuous optimization focused on driving measurable traffic and revenue growth for your Corrandulla business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your SEO services different?",
      "answer": "We combine 15+ years of SEO expertise with cutting-edge AI tools for superior insights and faster optimization. We're completely transparent about our methods and results. We focus on metrics that drive business growth - traffic, leads, and revenue - not just vanity metrics like rankings. Plus, we provide personalized service with direct access to our team."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should a Corrandulla business invest in SEO?",
      "answer": "Investment depends on your goals, competition, and growth timeline. Local campaigns often start at €1,200-€2,000/month, while more competitive strategies may require €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide custom proposals after understanding your specific situation, ensuring the investment aligns with expected returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you optimize my Google Business Profile?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Google Business Profile optimization is a crucial part of local SEO for Corrandulla businesses. We optimize your profile, manage reviews, add posts, and ensure you appear in Google Maps and local pack results when customers search for your services."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often will you report on my SEO progress?",
      "answer": "You'll receive comprehensive monthly reports detailing keyword rankings, traffic growth, user engagement, and conversion data. We also schedule regular strategy calls (typically monthly) to discuss performance, answer questions, and plan next steps for your Corrandulla business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my website is old or outdated?",
      "answer": "We can work with most existing websites! We'll identify technical limitations and recommend improvements. If your site has fundamental issues preventing good SEO performance, we may suggest a redesign. However, we often achieve strong results through optimization and improvements to existing sites."
