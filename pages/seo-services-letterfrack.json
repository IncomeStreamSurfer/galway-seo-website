  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can SEO help my Letterfrack tourism business?",
      "answer": "SEO helps you appear when tourists search for Connemara attractions, accommodations, restaurants, and activities. By ranking for relevant tourism keywords, you capture travelers in the planning phase, often before they book with competitors. This drives more website visits, inquiries, and ultimately bookings for your Letterfrack business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does tourism SEO take to show results?",
      "answer": "Tourism SEO typically shows initial results within 3-6 months, with substantial traffic growth by the following tourism season. Starting SEO before peak season (ideally 6-9 months prior) allows you to capture travelers during their planning phase. Results compound over time, with each year building on previous success."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I focus on local or tourist customers?",
      "answer": "Most Letterfrack businesses benefit from targeting both! We create strategies that capture tourist searches (people planning Connemara visits) and local searches (residents looking for services). The optimal balance depends on your business model and revenue sources."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle seasonal tourism demand?",
      "answer": "We optimize year-round while intensifying efforts before and during peak season. Content targets both immediate bookings and future trip planning. We also identify off-season opportunities to maintain visibility and capture early bookings for your Letterfrack business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What keywords should my Letterfrack business target?",
      "answer": "We target a mix of branded (your business name), local (Letterfrack + service), regional (Connemara + service), and tourism-focused keywords (things to do, where to stay, etc.). The specific mix depends on your business type and goals, identified through comprehensive keyword research."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should a Letterfrack tourism business invest in SEO?",
      "answer": "Investment varies based on your business size and goals. Small businesses often start at €1,200-€2,000/month for local optimization, while hotels and larger tourism operations may invest €3,000-€5,000/month for comprehensive campaigns. We provide custom proposals based on your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can SEO help during off-season?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Off-season SEO maintains visibility for early planners and captures different audience segments (locals, off-season travelers). It's also the ideal time to implement technical improvements and content development, ensuring you're ready when peak season demand arrives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success for tourism businesses?",
      "answer": "We track keyword rankings, organic traffic, geographic visitor data, inquiry submissions, booking conversions, and seasonal trends. Reports show both overall performance and segmented data (local vs tourist traffic) so you understand exactly how SEO drives results for your Letterfrack business."
