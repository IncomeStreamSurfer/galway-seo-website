  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads help my Barna business reach both locals and tourists?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We create dual-targeted campaigns—one focusing on local Barna residents searching for services, another targeting tourists searching for 'restaurants Barna', 'things to do Barna', or 'Galway Bay experiences'. Each has tailored messaging for maximum relevance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What budget works for businesses in Barna?",
      "answer": "It depends on your business type. Local service providers serving Barna residents can start with €800-€1,500/month. Tourism-focused businesses (restaurants, pubs, accommodations) typically need €1,200-€3,000+ monthly, especially during peak summer season. We'll recommend appropriate budgets during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you adjust campaigns for tourism seasonality?",
      "answer": "Yes! Seasonal optimization is included. We increase budgets during peak tourism months (May-September), major events, and weekends when coastal traffic is high. During quieter winter months, we focus more on local resident targeting to maintain year-round business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target people traveling along the Wild Atlantic Way?",
      "answer": "Yes! We target keywords like 'restaurants Wild Atlantic Way', 'things to do Galway Bay', and location-based searches from tourists traveling the coastal route. Mobile optimization captures travelers searching on-the-go for nearby options in Barna."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you optimize for mobile searchers?",
      "answer": "Mobile optimization is crucial for coastal businesses! We create mobile-specific ads with click-to-call buttons, location extensions showing your Barna address, and fast-loading mobile landing pages. This captures tourists and locals searching 'near me' on their phones."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my business is new in Barna?",
      "answer": "Google Ads is perfect for new businesses! Unlike SEO which takes months, PPC delivers immediate visibility. We can have your new Barna business appearing at the top of relevant searches within days, driving customers while you build your reputation and organic presence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target specific times of day or days of week?",
      "answer": "Yes! Ad scheduling lets us increase bids during your busiest/most profitable times (weekend evenings for restaurants, weekday mornings for services, etc.) and reduce spend during quiet periods. This maximizes ROI by focusing budget when conversion rates are highest."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure success for Barna businesses?",
      "answer": "We track all key metrics: clicks, impressions, conversions (calls, reservations, form submissions, directions requests), cost per conversion, and ROI. For coastal businesses, we also track seasonal performance patterns. You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly what Google Ads delivers."
