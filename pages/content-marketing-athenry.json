  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does content marketing benefit local businesses in Athenry?",
      "answer": "Content marketing is particularly effective for local businesses. It helps you appear in local search results, establishes you as the trusted expert in Athenry, builds relationships with potential customers, and creates lasting assets that continue working for your business long after publication - unlike paid ads that stop when you stop paying."

This ensures we create content your audience actually wants to read."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you create different types of content besides blog posts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While blog posts are a core component, we create diverse content types including whitepapers, ebooks, case studies, infographics, video scripts, email campaigns, social media content, landing pages, guides, and more. We'll recommend the best mix for your Athenry business and audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you make content match our brand voice?",
      "answer": "We start with a comprehensive brand voice discovery process, reviewing your existing materials and discussing your brand personality.

    },
    {
      "question": "What if we need content for a very niche industry?",
      "answer": "We specialize in creating content for specialized industries. Our research process allows us to quickly develop expertise in your niche.

You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly how content marketing is performing for your Athenry business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we start with a small package and scale up?",
