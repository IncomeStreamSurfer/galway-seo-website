  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can e-commerce benefit my Barna business?",
      "answer": "E-commerce allows you to sell 24/7, reach customers beyond Barna and Galway, capture tourist sales year-round, reduce dependence on seasonal traffic, and grow revenue significantly. Many Barna businesses see 30-60% revenue increases by adding e-commerce to their physical locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "What platform is best for my Barna business?",
      "answer": "We typically recommend Shopify for most Barna businesses due to its reliability, ease of use, mobile optimization, and comprehensive features. It's perfect for retail, hospitality, and artisan producers. We'll recommend the best platform based on your specific products and needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to build an online store?",
      "answer": "Most Shopify stores take 4-6 weeks from initial consultation to launch, including design, development, product setup, and testing. More complex stores may take 8-10 weeks. If you need to launch before peak season or a specific event, we can work with accelerated timelines for Barna businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you photograph my products in Barna?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer professional product photography services. We can photograph products at our studio, your Barna location, or even outdoors if that suits your brand (great for showcasing Barna's coastal setting). Quality product photos dramatically improve e-commerce conversion rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I invest in e-commerce marketing?",
      "answer": "Most successful Barna e-commerce businesses invest €2,500-€7,000/month in marketing services plus €1,000-€3,000/month in advertising budget. Investment depends on your revenue goals, products, and competition. We create custom strategies for your specific business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with international shipping?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We help you set up international shipping options, multi-currency support, and localized checkout experiences. Many Barna businesses want to sell to international tourists who visit and then order products online – we make this seamless."
    },
    {
      "question": "What results can I expect?",
      "answer": "Results vary by industry, but our Barna e-commerce clients typically see 20-40% increases in conversion rates, 50-100%+ increases in organic traffic within 6-12 months, and 3-5X return on ad spend. We focus on sustainable, profitable growth for your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide ongoing e-commerce support?",
      "answer": "Yes! Most Barna clients work with us on monthly retainers for ongoing store management, marketing optimization, technical support, and strategic guidance. We're committed to your long-term e-commerce success, not just a one-time website build."
