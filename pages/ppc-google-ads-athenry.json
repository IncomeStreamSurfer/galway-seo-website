  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can Google Ads help my Athenry business?",
      "answer": "Google Ads puts your business at the top of search results when Athenry residents and nearby customers search for what you offer. Whether they're searching 'plumber Athenry', 'restaurants near me', or 'accountant East Galway', your ads appear immediately, driving qualified traffic, leads, and sales."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a good starting budget for Google Ads in Athenry?",
      "answer": "For most Athenry businesses, €900-€1,500 per month (€30-50/day) is a good starting point to generate consistent leads. Service-based businesses often start around €1,000/month, while competitive industries may need €1,500-€3,000/month. We'll recommend the right budget for your specific situation during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target just Athenry or also surrounding areas?",
      "answer": "We can target precisely! Using advanced location settings, we can focus ads on Athenry only, Athenry plus a specific radius (5km, 10km, 20km), or include specific nearby towns like Oranmore, Craughwell, or Loughrea. You control exactly where your ads appear based on your service area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results?",
      "answer": "Google Ads delivers fast results—many Athenry businesses see leads within the first week. Initial results appear quickly, while optimal performance develops over 4-8 weeks as we test and refine campaigns. This is much faster than SEO which takes 3-6+ months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm competing with larger companies?",
      "answer": "Local businesses have advantages! We use geo-targeting to compete only in Athenry and East Galway (not nationwide), write ad copy emphasizing your local presence, and target long-tail keywords larger competitors ignore. Smart targeting and local positioning help you compete effectively."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you track phone calls from ads?",
      "answer": "We implement call tracking using unique phone numbers that show which ads and keywords generated each call. You'll see exactly how many phone calls came from Google Ads, what customers searched for, and the ROI on your ad spend. Essential for service businesses!"
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads work alongside my SEO efforts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! PPC and SEO complement each other perfectly. While SEO builds long-term organic rankings, Google Ads provides immediate visibility and traffic. Many successful Athenry businesses use both—PPC for quick wins and competitive keywords, SEO for sustained long-term growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my ads aren't performing?",
      "answer": "We continuously monitor and optimize campaigns. If performance isn't meeting expectations, we analyze data, adjust strategy, test new ad variations, refine targeting, optimize landing pages, and improve bids. Our commitment is to your success—we work until campaigns deliver positive ROI for your Athenry business."
