  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does SEO take to show results in Glenamaddy?",
      "answer": "SEO typically takes 3-6 months to show significant results, with continued improvement over time. Initial ranking changes often appear within 30-90 days, but substantial traffic growth usually occurs between months 6-12. SEO is a long-term strategy that delivers compounding returns for your Glenamaddy business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is SEO better than Google Ads for my Glenamaddy business?",
      "answer": "Both have their place! Google Ads delivers immediate traffic but stops when you stop paying. SEO builds long-term organic visibility that continues generating traffic without ongoing ad spend. For most Glenamaddy businesses, we recommend combining both for maximum impact."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine which keywords to target?",
      "answer": "We analyze search volume, competition, commercial intent, and relevance to your Glenamaddy business. We prioritize keywords that balance achievable rankings with strong revenue potential. Our keyword strategy evolves based on performance data and changing market conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your SEO services different?",
      "answer": "We combine 15+ years of SEO expertise with cutting-edge AI tools for deeper insights. We're completely transparent about our methods and results. We focus on metrics that matter – traffic, leads, and revenue for your Glenamaddy business – not just vanity metrics like rankings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should a Glenamaddy business invest in SEO?",
      "answer": "Investment depends on your goals, competition, and timeline. Local Glenamaddy campaigns often start at €1,200-€2,000/month, while more competitive strategies may require €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide custom proposals based on your specific situation and objectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you work with my existing website or do I need a new one?",
      "answer": "We can work with most existing websites! We'll identify any technical limitations and recommend improvements. If your site is extremely outdated or has fundamental issues, we may suggest a redesign, but we can often achieve strong results through optimization alone."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success?",
      "answer": "We track keyword rankings, organic traffic, user engagement, conversion rates, lead generation, and revenue impact. You'll receive monthly reports with all these metrics, and we schedule regular calls to discuss performance and strategy for your Glenamaddy business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not happy with the results?",
      "answer": "We work on a monthly basis with no long-term contracts. If you're not satisfied with our service, you can cancel anytime. That said, we maintain high retention rates because we deliver results and communicate transparently about progress and challenges."
