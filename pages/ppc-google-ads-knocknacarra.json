  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can you target just Knocknacarra or do ads show across Galway?",
      "answer": "We can target precisely! Using advanced location settings, we focus your ads on Knocknacarra residents, specific radius around your business location, or expand to cover West Galway/all of Galway depending on your service area. You only pay for clicks from your target customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's a realistic budget for local Google Ads in Knocknacarra?",
      "answer": "For most local service businesses in Knocknacarra, €900-€1,500 per month in ad spend (€30-50/day) generates good lead flow. Competitive industries may need €1,500-€3,000/month. We'll recommend an appropriate budget based on your industry, competition, and goals during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see leads from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads can generate leads within days of launching. Many Knocknacarra businesses see their first leads within the first week. Peak performance typically develops over 4-8 weeks as we optimize campaigns, but you'll see results much faster than SEO."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of Knocknacarra businesses benefit from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Almost any business serving Knocknacarra! We've successfully managed campaigns for home service providers (plumbers, electricians, cleaners), healthcare professionals, restaurants, retailers, professional services, fitness centers, and more. If locals search for what you offer, Google Ads can work."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you prevent ads from showing outside my service area?",
      "answer": "We use precise geographic targeting to ensure ads only show to users in your defined service area (Knocknacarra, West Galway, etc.). We can also exclude specific areas where you don't operate. This prevents wasted clicks from people outside your service area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads help with 'near me' searches?",
      "answer": "Yes! 'Near me' searches are powerful for local businesses. We optimize campaigns to appear for location-based searches like 'plumber near me' when someone in Knocknacarra searches. Mobile optimization is critical for capturing these high-intent local searches."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I track phone calls from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "We implement call tracking that shows exactly which keywords and ads generated phone calls. You'll see how many calls came from Google Ads, what they searched for, and the ROI on your ad spend. This is crucial for service businesses where calls are the primary conversion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm competing with national companies in Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Local businesses have advantages! We use geo-targeting, local ad copy highlighting your Knocknacarra presence, location extensions, and strategic keyword selection to compete effectively against larger companies. Many searchers prefer local businesses—we position you to win those customers."
