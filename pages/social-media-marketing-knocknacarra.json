  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which social media platforms should my Knocknacarra business use?",
      "answer": "It depends on your business type and target audience. Local service businesses (plumbers, electricians, cleaners) do well on Facebook for community reach. Lifestyle businesses (fitness, beauty, cafes) excel on Instagram. B2B and professional services perform well on LinkedIn. We'll analyze your audience and recommend the optimal platform mix."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should we post on social media?",
      "answer": "For Knocknacarra businesses, we typically recommend 3-5 posts per week on Instagram, 5-7 on Facebook, and 2-3 on LinkedIn. Consistency matters more than frequency – it's better to post quality content regularly than flood followers with quantity. We create strategic schedules that maintain engagement without overwhelming your audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you create all our social media content?",
      "answer": "Yes! We handle complete content creation – strategy, copywriting, graphic design, photo editing, and video production. While we may occasionally request photos of your products, team, or location in Knocknacarra, we manage the entire creative process so you can focus on running your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before we see business results from social media?",
      "answer": "You'll see engagement and follower growth within 1-3 months. Meaningful business impact (website traffic, inquiries, sales) typically develops over 3-6 months as we build an engaged community around your Knocknacarra brand. Social media is a long-term strategy that compounds over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we invest in paid social media advertising?",
      "answer": "Yes, we recommend it. While organic content builds long-term community, paid advertising accelerates growth significantly. Even modest budgets (€200-€500 monthly) can help you reach new audiences in Knocknacarra and West Galway faster, promote specific offers, and drive immediate actions. We typically recommend allocating 20-30% of social budget to paid campaigns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you target local Knocknacarra customers on social media?",
      "answer": "We use geographic targeting in paid campaigns to reach users in Knocknacarra and surrounding areas. Organically, we use location tags, local hashtags (#Knocknacarra, #GalwayBusiness), engage with local accounts, and create content featuring recognizable Knocknacarra locations. This builds strong local community connection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help if we have old, dormant social media accounts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Many of our most successful Knocknacarra clients came to us with neglected accounts. We'll audit existing profiles, refresh them with professional branding, clean up old content if needed, and revitalize your presence with strategic new content that rebuilds and grows your community."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure social media success?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics: follower growth rate, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), reach and impressions, website clicks, lead generation, and conversion tracking. Most importantly, we connect social media activity to real business outcomes – showing how your investment drives inquiries, sales, and revenue for your Knocknacarra business."
