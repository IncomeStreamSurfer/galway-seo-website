Our track record speaks for itself - most Renmore clients achieve first-page rankings for their primary target keywords within 6-9 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost for a Renmore business?",
      "answer": "SEO investment for Renmore businesses varies based on goals, industry competition, and current website status.

      "answer": "We track multiple success metrics including keyword rankings (position on Google), organic traffic growth, click-through rates, conversion rates, lead generation, and ultimately revenue impact. You'll receive detailed monthly reports and regular strategy sessions to review performance and ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you use any risky SEO tactics?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not. We exclusively use white-hat, Google-approved SEO techniques. Black-hat tactics might offer short-term gains but risk severe penalties that can devastate your online presence. We build sustainable, long-term SEO success that protects and grows your Renmore business."
