  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long before my Dunmore business sees SEO results?",
      "answer": "SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Most businesses see ranking improvements within 2-4 months, with significant traffic increases by 6-12 months. The timeline varies based on your industry, current website status, and keyword competition. We provide progress updates monthly so you can track improvements every step of the way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the ROI of SEO for Dunmore businesses?",
      "answer": "SEO typically delivers one of the highest ROIs of any marketing channel. Unlike paid ads that require continuous spending, organic rankings compound over time. Many of our Dunmore clients see 5-10x ROI within the first year, with returns increasing as rankings and authority grow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you promise my business will rank #1 on Google?",
      "answer": "We can't ethically guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithm involves hundreds of constantly changing factors. What we can promise is our expertise, transparent communication, proven strategies, and relentless focus on driving measurable results for your Dunmore business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum commitment for SEO services?",
      "answer": "We work on a monthly basis with no long-term contracts. While we recommend at least 6-12 months to see substantial results, you're free to pause or cancel anytime. We believe our results should speak for themselves and earn your continued business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with businesses outside Dunmore?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While we serve many businesses in Dunmore and East Galway, we work with clients throughout Ireland and internationally. Our SEO strategies work regardless of location, though we do excel at local SEO for businesses serving specific geographic areas."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is your SEO different from doing it myself?",
      "answer": "SEO requires specialized technical knowledge, content expertise, industry connections for link building, and constant monitoring. Our team brings 15+ years of experience, proven strategies, established relationships, and AI-powered tools that would take years and significant investment to develop independently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I need to make changes to my website?",
      "answer": "Yes, effective SEO often requires technical updates, content improvements, and sometimes structural changes. We'll present all recommendations clearly, explain why they're important, and either implement them ourselves or guide your team through the process."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often will you report on SEO progress?",
      "answer": "You'll receive comprehensive monthly reports detailing rankings, traffic, conversions, and key performance metrics. We also schedule regular strategy calls to discuss performance, answer questions, and plan next steps for your Dunmore business."
