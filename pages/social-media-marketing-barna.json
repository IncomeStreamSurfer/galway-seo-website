  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Which social media platforms should my Barna business be on?",
      "answer": "It depends on your target audience and business goals. Most local Barna businesses benefit from Facebook and Instagram for community building. LinkedIn is essential for B2B services, while TikTok and YouTube work well for brands targeting younger demographics. We'll help you identify the right platforms during our strategy session."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often should we post on social media?",
      "answer": "Posting frequency varies by platform and audience. Generally, we recommend 4-7 posts per week on Facebook/Instagram, daily stories, 3-5 weekly posts on LinkedIn, and more frequent content on TikTok and Twitter. Quality always trumps quantity – we focus on creating engaging content that resonates with your Barna audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you create the content or do we need to provide it?",
      "answer": "We handle all content creation including copywriting, graphic design, and video production. You're welcome to provide ideas, brand assets, or specific content you'd like featured, but our team will manage the entire creative process to ensure consistent, professional content."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure social media success?",
      "answer": "We track metrics that matter to your business: engagement rates, follower growth, website traffic from social, lead generation, and ultimately conversions and revenue. You'll receive monthly reports showing how your social media efforts impact your bottom line, not just vanity metrics."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I spend on social media advertising?",
      "answer": "Social media ad budgets vary widely based on your goals and competition. For local Barna businesses, we often recommend starting with €300-€500 per month for Facebook/Instagram ads. Larger campaigns targeting broader audiences may require €1,500-€5,000+ monthly. We'll help you determine the right investment for your goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you manage our existing social media accounts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We can take over management of your existing accounts, conduct an audit to optimize them, and implement our strategic approach. We'll ensure a smooth transition and work to improve performance from day one."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle negative comments or reviews?",
      "answer": "We monitor your social channels daily and respond professionally to all feedback, including negative comments. Our approach is transparent, empathetic, and solution-focused. We'll work with you to develop response guidelines that protect your brand reputation while addressing concerns constructively."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your social media marketing different from others?",
      "answer": "We combine AI-powered insights with human creativity and local Barna market knowledge. Unlike agencies that use generic templates, we create custom strategies tailored to your brand, audience, and goals. Our focus is on building authentic communities that drive real business results, not just follower counts."
