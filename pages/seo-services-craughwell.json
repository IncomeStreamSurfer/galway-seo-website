  "faq": [
    {

SEO is a long-term investment that builds sustainable growth rather than temporary spikes. We provide monthly reports tracking your progress in rankings, traffic, leads, and conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should my Craughwell business focus on local or national SEO?",
