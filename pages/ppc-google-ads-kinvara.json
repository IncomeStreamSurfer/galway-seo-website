  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much should tourism businesses in Kinvara budget for Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Tourism businesses should consider seasonal budgets – €2,000-€5,000+ per month during peak visitor season (May-September) when demand is highest, and €500-€1,000 monthly in off-season to maintain visibility. This allows you to capture high-intent visitors when they're planning trips to Kinvara."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads help my hospitality business in Kinvara?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Google Ads is highly effective for accommodation, restaurants, and activity providers in Kinvara. We can target tourists searching for 'hotels near Dunguaire Castle', 'Kinvara restaurants', 'things to do Wild Atlantic Way' and similar high-intent keywords that drive bookings."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see bookings from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Your ads can appear within hours, generating immediate visibility. Bookings often come quickly for tourism businesses, especially during peak season. Optimal performance develops over 4-8 weeks as we refine targeting. Most Kinvara tourism businesses see positive ROI within their first season."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with non-tourism businesses in Kinvara?",
      "answer": "Yes! While tourism is a major part of Kinvara's economy, we work with all types of businesses – local services, retail shops, professional services, and more. Our PPC strategies are customized to your specific industry and target audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help target both tourists and local customers?",
      "answer": "Definitely! We can create separate campaign groups – one targeting visitors searching for tourism keywords, another targeting local residents searching for services in Kinvara. Each campaign uses different messaging and landing pages optimized for that specific audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm a small business with a limited budget?",
      "answer": "We work with businesses of all sizes in Kinvara. Even with budgets as low as €500-€750 monthly, we can create focused campaigns targeting your most valuable keywords. As you see results, you can gradually scale investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a long-term contract?",
      "answer": "No, we operate on flexible month-to-month agreements. This is especially beneficial for seasonal businesses in Kinvara – you can increase budgets during peak season and reduce or pause during quieter months without penalties."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you create landing pages for my campaigns?",
      "answer": "Yes! High-converting landing pages are crucial for Google Ads success, especially for tourism businesses. We create custom pages optimized for bookings, inquiries, or whatever action you want visitors to take."
