  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long before I see SEO results in Ballybane?",
      "answer": "Typically, Ballybane businesses start noticing ranking improvements within 3-6 months, with significant traffic growth appearing by 6-12 months. SEO delivers lasting results but requires patience. Unlike paid ads that stop when you stop paying, SEO builds long-term value. We provide monthly updates tracking your progress."

      "answer": "For most Ballybane businesses, we recommend starting with local SEO to capture customers searching for services in your area (like 'shop near Ballybane' or 'services in Galway'). Once you dominate local search, we can expand to national keywords. We'll analyze your specific situation and recommend the best approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you guarantee my business will rank #1 on Google?",
      "answer": "No ethical SEO agency can guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithms constantly evolve. However, we guarantee our commitment to proven strategies, ethical practices, and transparent reporting. Our track record shows most Ballybane clients achieve page-one rankings for their main keywords within their first year."
    },
    {
      "question": "What will SEO cost my Ballybane business?",
      "answer": "SEO investment varies based on your goals, industry competition, and current website status. Local SEO for Ballybane businesses typically starts around €1,200 per month. More competitive campaigns for regional or national reach may be €2,500-€5,000 monthly. We provide free audits and custom quotes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What exactly is included in your SEO service?",
      "answer": "Our complete SEO service includes comprehensive website audits, keyword research and strategy, technical optimization, content creation and optimization, on-page SEO, strategic link building, local SEO management, competitor analysis, monthly detailed reports, and regular strategy calls with your account manager."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you create content for my website?",
      "answer": "Yes! Content creation is a core part of our SEO service. Our experienced writers produce SEO-optimized blog posts, service pages, landing pages, and other content that ranks well on Google while engaging your Ballybane audience and driving conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How will I know if SEO is working for my business?",
      "answer": "You'll receive comprehensive monthly reports showing keyword rankings, organic traffic growth, user behavior, conversion metrics, and ROI. We also schedule regular strategy calls to review performance, discuss insights, and plan next steps. Transparency is fundamental to how we work."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is your SEO approach safe and ethical?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We exclusively use white-hat SEO techniques that fully comply with Google's webmaster guidelines.
