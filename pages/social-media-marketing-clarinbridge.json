  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can social media help my Clarinbridge business?",
      "answer": "Social media helps Clarinbridge businesses build local brand awareness, engage directly with customers, showcase your offerings, drive foot traffic or website visits, generate leads, and increase sales. It's particularly effective for hospitality, retail, and service businesses looking to strengthen community connections and attract both locals and visitors to the area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which platforms should my Clarinbridge business focus on?",
      "answer": "For most Clarinbridge businesses, Facebook and Instagram are essential due to their strong local presence. Hospitality businesses benefit greatly from Instagram's visual focus. LinkedIn works well for professional services and B2B. We'll assess your specific business type, target audience, and goals to recommend the optimal platform strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you create all the content or do we need to provide it?",
      "answer": "We handle complete content creation including copywriting, graphic design, photography, and video production. While we welcome your input, ideas, and any specific content you'd like featured, our team manages all creative production to ensure professional, consistent content that aligns with your brand and resonates with your Clarinbridge audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time does social media marketing take?",
      "answer": "When you work with Kraft Agency, social media requires minimal time from you. We handle strategy, content creation, scheduling, posting, community management, and reporting.

    },
    {
      "question": "What results can we expect from social media marketing?",
      "answer": "Results vary by business type and goals, but most Clarinbridge businesses see increased brand awareness, higher engagement with local customers, more website traffic, increased inquiries or bookings, and improved customer loyalty within 3-6 months. We provide regular reports showing exactly how social media impacts your specific business objectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we invest in paid social media advertising?",
      "answer": "Paid advertising significantly amplifies your reach and accelerates results. While organic content builds community, paid ads allow precise targeting of ideal customers in Clarinbridge and surrounding areas, promote specific offers or events, and drive measurable conversions. We typically recommend combining organic and paid strategies for optimal results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure social media success?",
      "answer": "We track metrics aligned with your business goals: engagement rates, reach and impressions, follower growth, website traffic from social, lead generation, conversion rates, and ROI. You'll receive monthly reports showing these metrics along with insights and recommendations. Our focus is on metrics that impact your bottom line, not just vanity numbers."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we already have social media accounts?",
      "answer": "Perfect! We can take over management of your existing accounts. We'll conduct a comprehensive audit, optimize your profiles, develop an improved strategy, and implement our approach. Many Clarinbridge businesses come to us with established accounts but inconsistent results – we'll transform them into powerful business growth tools."
