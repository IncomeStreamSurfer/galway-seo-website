  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much should my Galway business spend on Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Budget depends on your industry, competition, and goals. For most Galway City businesses, we recommend starting with €1,000-€2,000 per month (€30-60/day) to gather data and see results. Competitive industries like legal services or home services may need higher budgets. We'll recommend an appropriate budget during your free audit based on your specific situation and goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads can drive traffic and leads almost immediately once campaigns launch. However, optimization takes time—we typically see peak performance after 2-3 months of testing and refinement. Unlike SEO, PPC delivers fast results, but best ROI comes from continuous optimization over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between Google Ads and SEO?",
      "answer": "Google Ads (PPC) puts you at the top of search results immediately through paid placements, while SEO builds organic rankings over time. PPC offers immediate, controllable traffic but requires ongoing spend. SEO takes longer but delivers sustained traffic without per-click costs. Most successful Galway businesses use both strategies together."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target specific areas within Galway City?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We use advanced location targeting to focus on specific neighborhoods, postcodes, or radius targeting around your business location in Galway City. This ensures your ads reach potential customers in your service area while avoiding wasted spend on irrelevant locations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure Google Ads success?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics including clicks, impressions, click-through rate (CTR), cost per click (CPC), conversion rate, cost per acquisition (CPA), and most importantly, return on ad spend (ROAS). You'll see exactly how many leads, sales, calls, or store visits your Google Ads generate and what ROI you're achieving."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of businesses in Galway benefit from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Almost any business can benefit! We've successfully managed campaigns for Galway retailers, restaurants, professional services (legal, accounting, medical), home services (plumbers, electricians), B2B companies, e-commerce stores, tourism businesses, and more. If people search Google for what you offer, Google Ads can work for you."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you manage campaigns beyond Search Ads?",
      "answer": "Yes! We manage the full range of Google Ads campaign types including Search Ads, Display Ads, Shopping Ads for e-commerce, YouTube Video Ads, and Remarketing campaigns. We'll recommend the right mix for your Galway business goals and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your management fee structure?",
      "answer": "Our management fees typically range from 15-20% of your monthly ad spend, with a minimum starting at €500/month for smaller campaigns. This includes strategy, setup, optimization, reporting, and ongoing account management. We believe in transparent pricing with no hidden fees—you'll know exactly what you're paying for."
