  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What exactly does AI marketing do that traditional marketing doesn't?",
      "answer": "AI marketing uses machine learning to analyze vast data sets, predict customer behavior, personalize at scale, and optimize continuously—all automatically. While traditional marketing relies on manual analysis and fixed rules, AI adapts in real-time based on results, learning what works best for your specific Craughwell audience and improving continuously."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can small businesses in Craughwell afford AI marketing?",
      "answer": "Yes! AI marketing is more accessible than ever. Basic implementations like chatbots start from €1,500 setup + €300/month—often less than hiring part-time help but providing 24/7 capability. Most small Craughwell businesses see positive ROI within 2-3 months as AI captures leads and improves efficiency that offset the investment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see results from AI marketing?",
      "answer": "Many AI features deliver immediate benefits—chatbots start capturing leads from day one, automated sequences begin nurturing prospects instantly. However, AI gets smarter over time as it learns from your data. Most Craughwell businesses see measurable improvements within 30-60 days, with results continuing to improve over 6-12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will AI replace my marketing team or my role?",
      "answer": "No! AI augments human capabilities, not replaces them. Think of AI as a super-powered assistant handling repetitive tasks, data analysis, and optimization—freeing your team for strategy, creativity, and relationship building. Many Craughwell businesses find their teams become more effective and enjoy their work more with AI support."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I don't have much customer data for AI to learn from?",
      "answer": "AI can still provide value! We supplement your data with industry benchmarks and best practices to train initial models. As your AI systems interact with customers, they quickly build your unique data set. Even businesses starting with limited data see benefits, with performance improving rapidly as AI learns."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you ensure AI respects customer privacy and GDPR?",
      "answer": "Data privacy is paramount. All our AI systems are GDPR-compliant, use encryption for data security, obtain proper consent, and never share customer information with third parties. AI processes data securely to improve marketing while respecting privacy regulations and customer trust. We take compliance very seriously."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can AI work with my existing marketing tools and website?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our AI solutions integrate with virtually all popular platforms including WordPress, Shopify, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Salesforce, Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and more. We ensure seamless integration without disrupting your current workflows or requiring platform changes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I'm not satisfied with AI marketing results?",
      "answer": "We offer a 30-day satisfaction guarantee. If you're not seeing value from our AI marketing solutions, we'll work with you to adjust the strategy or provide a refund. However, in 15+ years, we've successfully implemented AI across hundreds of businesses with positive results. We're confident AI will benefit your Craughwell business."
