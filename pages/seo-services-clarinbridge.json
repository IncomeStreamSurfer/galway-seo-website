    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see SEO results in Clarinbridge?",
      "answer": "Most Clarinbridge businesses start seeing improved rankings within 3-6 months, with significant traffic increases by 6-12 months. SEO is a long-term investment that builds sustainable results. Local SEO often shows faster results than competitive national keywords. We provide regular progress reports so you can track improvements throughout your journey."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between local and national SEO?",
      "answer": "Local SEO focuses on ranking for location-specific searches like 'services in Clarinbridge' or 'near me' queries, ideal for businesses serving Clarinbridge and surrounding areas. National SEO targets broader keywords across Ireland. We help Clarinbridge businesses determine the right strategy based on their service area and goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you guarantee first page Google rankings?",
      "answer": "While we can't ethically guarantee specific rankings due to Google's constantly evolving algorithm, we do guarantee our commitment to best practices and data-driven optimization. Our track record speaks for itself – the majority of our Clarinbridge clients achieve first-page rankings for their target keywords within 6-12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost for Clarinbridge businesses?",
      "answer": "SEO investment varies based on your goals, industry competition, and current website status. Local SEO campaigns for Clarinbridge businesses typically start from €1,500/month, while competitive national campaigns may be €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide transparent custom quotes after our initial audit."

    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with content creation for SEO?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Content is crucial for SEO success. Our content team creates SEO-optimized blog posts, service pages, and website copy that ranks well and converts Clarinbridge visitors into customers. We focus on creating valuable content that serves both search engines and your audience."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success for Clarinbridge businesses?",

You'll receive detailed monthly reports and regular strategy sessions to review performance and plan next steps."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you only use white-hat SEO techniques?",
      "answer": "Yes, exclusively. We only use white-hat, Google-approved SEO techniques. Black-hat tactics might offer short-term gains but risk severe penalties that can devastate your online presence. We build sustainable, long-term SEO success for Clarinbridge businesses using ethical strategies."
