  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can e-commerce help my Salthill business?",
      "answer": "E-commerce allows you to reach customers 24/7, sell to tourists before they visit Salthill, capture online searches for products you sell, reduce dependence on seasonal foot traffic, and grow revenue beyond your physical location. Many Salthill businesses see 30-50% revenue growth by adding e-commerce."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you optimize my store for mobile shoppers?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Mobile optimization is critical for Salthill businesses since many tourists and local shoppers browse on phones. Every store we build is mobile-first, with fast loading, easy navigation, and seamless checkout on smartphones and tablets."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to launch an online store?",
      "answer": "Most Shopify stores launch in 4-6 weeks including design, development, product setup, payment integration, and testing. If you need to launch before tourist season or for a specific event in Salthill, we can work with accelerated timelines."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best e-commerce platform for Salthill businesses?",
      "answer": "We typically recommend Shopify for most Salthill retail and hospitality businesses due to its ease of use, mobile optimization, reliable hosting, and extensive features. It's perfect for businesses that need to focus on sales rather than technical management."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with international sales and shipping?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many Salthill businesses want to sell to international tourists who visit and then order products online. We set up multi-currency support, international shipping options, and localized checkout experiences to make international sales seamless."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I invest in e-commerce marketing?",
      "answer": "Most successful Salthill e-commerce businesses invest €2,500-€6,000/month in marketing services plus €1,000-€3,000/month in advertising budget. We create custom strategies based on your revenue goals, products, and target markets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer product photography in Salthill?",
      "answer": "Yes! We provide professional product photography services. We can photograph products at our studio, your Salthill location, or even outdoors along the promenade if that suits your brand. High-quality product photos significantly increase e-commerce conversion rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help manage seasonal fluctuations?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We understand Salthill's seasonal tourism patterns. We help you maximize summer tourist sales while building year-round online revenue through strategic marketing, seasonal campaigns, and customer retention programs that keep sales steady in quieter months."
