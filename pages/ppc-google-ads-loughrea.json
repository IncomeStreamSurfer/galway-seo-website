  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much should my Loughrea business spend on Google Ads?",
      "answer": "For most Loughrea businesses, €900-€1,500 per month (€30-50/day) generates good lead flow. Service businesses often need €1,000-€2,000/month, while competitive industries may require €2,000-€4,000/month. We'll provide specific budget recommendations based on your industry, competition, and goals during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target specific areas around Loughrea?",
      "answer": "Yes! We use advanced location targeting to focus ads on Loughrea town, specific radius around your business (5km, 15km, 30km), or include specific nearby towns like Athenry, Gort, or Craughwell. This ensures your budget reaches customers in your exact service area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will my business see leads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads can generate leads within days of launching. Many Loughrea businesses see initial leads in the first week. Peak performance typically develops over 4-8 weeks as we gather data and optimize campaigns, but results come much faster than SEO's 3-6 month timeframe."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your Google Ads service better for Loughrea?",
      "answer": "We combine certified Google Partner expertise with genuine East Galway market knowledge. We understand Loughrea's business landscape, local competition, and customer behavior. This local insight combined with advanced PPC techniques delivers better-performing campaigns specifically optimized for the Loughrea market."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure if Google Ads is working?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics: clicks, impressions, click-through rate, conversion rate, cost per lead/sale, phone calls, form submissions, and most importantly, ROI. You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly how many leads or sales Google Ads generated and what you're paying for each."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads help with 'near me' searches?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! 'Near me' searches are powerful for local businesses. We optimize campaigns to appear when Loughrea residents search 'dentist near me', 'plumber near me', etc. Location extensions show your Loughrea address, and mobile optimization captures these high-intent local searches."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I have a small budget?",
      "answer": "We work with businesses of all sizes! While larger budgets generate more leads, we can create effective campaigns starting around €800-€1,000/month for Loughrea businesses. We focus on high-intent keywords, tight geographic targeting, and optimization to maximize results from smaller budgets."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer any guarantees?",
      "answer": "While we can't guarantee specific rankings or results (Google's algorithm changes constantly and depends on many factors), we do guarantee: certified Google Partner expertise, continuous optimization, transparent reporting, and our commitment to driving positive ROI. Most Loughrea businesses see strong results within 2-3 months."
