    {
      "question": "What budget do I need for Google Ads in Gort?",
      "answer": "We recommend starting with €500-€1,000 per month in ad spend for local Gort campaigns, plus management fees of €750+. This budget allows for effective testing and optimization while reaching qualified customers in Gort and surrounding South Galway areas. Businesses can scale up as they see positive returns."
    },

      "question": "Do I need to sign a long-term contract?",
      "answer": "No, we operate on flexible month-to-month agreements. While we recommend at least 3-6 months for campaigns to fully optimize and deliver best results, you're never locked into a long-term contract. We earn your continued business through consistent performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure success for Google Ads campaigns?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics including impressions, clicks, cost-per-click, conversions, cost-per-acquisition, conversion rate, and most importantly – return on ad spend (ROAS). You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing all metrics, plus 24/7 access to live performance dashboards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my current Google Ads aren't working?",
      "answer": "We offer free PPC audits to diagnose issues with underperforming campaigns. Common problems include poor keyword selection, weak ad copy, unoptimized landing pages, or inadequate tracking. We can take over management and typically improve performance significantly within the first month."
