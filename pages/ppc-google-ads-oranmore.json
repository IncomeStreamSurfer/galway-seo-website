  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much should my Oranmore business invest in Google Ads?",
      "answer": "For most local Oranmore businesses, we recommend starting with €750-€1,500 per month in ad spend to see meaningful results. This allows enough budget to compete for relevant keywords while gathering data for optimization. Service-based businesses often need higher budgets during competitive seasons. We'll provide specific recommendations during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target just Oranmore or specific areas in East Galway?",
      "answer": "Yes! We use precise location targeting to focus your ads on Oranmore, specific neighborhoods, or a custom radius around your business. We can also target multiple locations like Oranmore + Galway City + Athenry. This ensures your budget reaches potential customers in your service area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will my business see leads from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads can generate leads within days of launch. However, optimal performance typically develops over 4-8 weeks as we gather data, test variations, and refine targeting. The advantage of PPC is immediate visibility—you're not waiting months like with SEO."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with businesses in Oranmore's business parks?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We work with B2B and professional service businesses throughout Oranmore's commercial areas, including companies in IDA Business Park and local business districts. Google Ads works excellently for both B2B and B2C businesses in Oranmore."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your Google Ads management different?",
      "answer": "We're based in Oranmore, giving us deep local market knowledge that remote agencies lack. We're also a certified Google Partner with advanced expertise. This combination of local insight and technical excellence means better-performing campaigns specifically optimized for the Oranmore and East Galway market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads work alongside my SEO efforts?",
      "answer": "Definitely! PPC and SEO work beautifully together. While SEO builds long-term organic rankings, Google Ads provides immediate visibility and traffic. Many Oranmore businesses use PPC to drive results while SEO develops, then maintain ads for competitive keywords and quick wins."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if Google Ads is working for my business?",
      "answer": "We provide detailed monthly reports showing all key metrics: clicks, conversions, cost per lead/sale, ROI, and phone call tracking. You'll see exactly how many leads or sales Google Ads generates and what you're paying for each. Complete transparency is guaranteed."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my Google Ads aren't performing well?",
      "answer": "We continuously optimize campaigns to improve performance. If results aren't meeting expectations, we analyze data, adjust strategy, refine targeting, test new ad variations, and optimize bids. Our goal is always positive ROI—we work persistently until campaigns deliver results for your Oranmore business."
