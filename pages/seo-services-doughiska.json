  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see SEO results for my Doughiska business?",
      "answer": "Most businesses in Doughiska begin seeing ranking improvements within 3-4 months, with substantial traffic growth typically occurring between 6-12 months. SEO is a marathon, not a sprint - we build sustainable, long-term growth rather than temporary spikes. We'll provide monthly updates showing your progress."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes local SEO different from regular SEO?",
      "answer": "Local SEO targets geographic-specific searches like 'restaurants near Doughiska' or 'plumber in Galway', focusing on Google Maps rankings and local pack results. Regular (national) SEO targets broader keywords across Ireland. We recommend local SEO for businesses serving the Doughiska area, and national SEO for companies targeting customers across Ireland."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer guaranteed rankings?",
      "answer": "We don't offer guaranteed rankings as Google's algorithm is constantly evolving and no ethical SEO agency can guarantee specific positions. However, we do guarantee our dedication to best practices, transparent reporting, and continuous optimization. Our track record shows that most Doughiska clients reach first-page rankings for their target keywords."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does SEO cost for businesses in Doughiska?",
      "answer": "SEO pricing varies based on competition level, business goals, and current website condition. Local campaigns for Doughiska businesses typically start at €1,200/month, while more competitive regional or national campaigns range from €2,500-€5,000/month. We'll provide a custom quote after analyzing your specific situation."

    },
    {
      "question": "Can you write content for my Doughiska business?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! High-quality content is essential for SEO success. Our professional content writers create engaging, SEO-optimized content including blog articles, service pages, landing pages, and website copy that ranks well on Google and converts Doughiska visitors into customers."
