    {
      "question": "How can marketing automation help my Ballinasloe business grow?",
      "answer": "Marketing automation helps Ballinasloe businesses save time, improve lead quality, and increase conversions. By automating repetitive tasks like email follow-ups, lead scoring, and customer segmentation, you free up your team while engaging prospects more effectively. Most clients see 35-50% improvements in conversion rates within 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What marketing processes should we automate first?",
      "answer": "We typically prioritize email nurturing campaigns, welcome sequences, lead scoring, and abandoned cart recovery—the highest-impact workflows. From there, we expand to customer onboarding, re-engagement campaigns, event follow-ups, social media automation, and sophisticated multi-channel journeys."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which marketing automation platform do you recommend?",
      "answer": "We're platform-agnostic and recommend solutions based on your specific needs. HubSpot offers comprehensive all-in-one functionality, ActiveCampaign provides powerful automation at mid-market pricing, Marketo suits enterprise requirements, and Mailchimp works well for smaller businesses. We'll guide you to the perfect fit during our consultation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can marketing automation integrate with our CRM?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! CRM integration is crucial for effective automation. We have extensive experience with Salesforce, HubSpot CRM, Pipedrive, Zoho, Microsoft Dynamics, and other major platforms. Integration ensures your marketing and sales teams work from unified customer data for maximum effectiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will we see results?",
      "answer": "Many clients see initial improvements within 2-4 weeks as foundational workflows go live. Substantial results—like significant increases in conversion rates and lead quality—typically appear within 2-3 months as automation matures and we implement ongoing optimizations."
    },
    {
      "question": "Won't automated marketing feel robotic to customers?",
      "answer": "Not when implemented correctly! Modern automation enables hyper-personalization through behavioral triggers, dynamic content, and AI. We design automation that delivers the right message to the right person at the right time—creating experiences that feel personal and relevant, not automated."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the investment for marketing automation?",
      "answer": "Investment depends on platform choice, workflow complexity, and scale. Small business automation typically starts at €1,200/month (including platform and management). Enterprise solutions range from €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide detailed proposals after understanding your specific needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure automation success?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics including email engagement rates, conversion rates, lead nurturing velocity, pipeline contribution, customer lifetime value, time saved, and overall marketing ROI. You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly how automation impacts your Ballinasloe business."
