  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How quickly will my Carnmore business see SEO results?",
      "answer": "Most businesses see initial ranking improvements within 2-4 months, with substantial traffic growth typically between 6-12 months. SEO is a long-term strategy that builds momentum - unlike paid ads that stop when you stop paying, organic rankings continue delivering traffic and leads for your Carnmore business over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the ROI of SEO for Carnmore businesses?",
      "answer": "SEO typically delivers one of the highest ROIs of any marketing channel. While it requires upfront investment, organic traffic continues flowing without ongoing ad costs. Many Carnmore clients see 5-10x ROI within the first year, with returns increasing as rankings strengthen and authority grows over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you guarantee first page rankings?",
      "answer": "We can't ethically guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithm involves hundreds of constantly changing factors. What we can guarantee is our expertise, proven strategies, transparent reporting, and unwavering focus on driving measurable traffic, leads, and revenue growth for your Carnmore business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your SEO service?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive SEO includes technical optimization, keyword research and targeting, content strategy and creation, on-page optimization, strategic link building, local SEO (Google Business Profile, citations), competitor monitoring, monthly reporting, and regular strategy consultations tailored to your Carnmore business needs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I budget for SEO?",
      "answer": "Investment varies based on goals, competition, and timeline. Carnmore businesses typically invest €1,200-€2,000/month for local SEO, or €3,000-€5,000/month for more competitive campaigns. We provide custom proposals after analyzing your specific situation, ensuring investment aligns with expected returns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a new website or can you work with my existing one?",
      "answer": "We can work with most existing websites! We'll identify technical limitations and recommend improvements. If your site has fundamental issues preventing SEO success, we may suggest a redesign. However, we often achieve excellent results through optimization and improvements to existing Carnmore business websites."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success?",
      "answer": "We track multiple metrics including keyword rankings, organic traffic growth, user engagement, conversion rates, lead generation, and revenue impact. Monthly reports provide comprehensive data, and we schedule regular calls to discuss performance and strategy adjustments for your Carnmore business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm not satisfied with the results?",
      "answer": "We operate on a monthly basis with no long-term contracts. While we recommend at least 6-12 months to see substantial results (SEO takes time to build momentum), you maintain flexibility to pause or cancel. We believe our results should earn your continued partnership, not a contract."
