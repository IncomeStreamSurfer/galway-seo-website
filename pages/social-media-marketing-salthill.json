  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can social media help my Salthill tourism business?",
      "answer": "Social media is crucial for tourism businesses in Salthill. Instagram and Facebook allow you to showcase Salthill's stunning coastal scenery, your business offerings, and create FOMO that drives bookings. We can target tourists planning Galway visits, create seasonal campaigns, and build a following that generates consistent bookings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we post more during summer tourist season?",
      "answer": "Yes! We recommend increased posting frequency and paid advertising during peak season (May-September) to capture tourist attention. However, maintaining year-round presence is important for building long-term brand awareness and capturing early planners who book months in advance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you create content featuring Salthill's coastal location?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Salthill's waterfront, the Prom, beaches, and coastal views are perfect for visually-driven social media. We'll create stunning content showcasing your business's location, integrate local landmarks, and leverage Salthill's natural beauty to make your brand stand out."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you help local Salthill businesses compete with tourism operators?",
      "answer": "We create separate strategies for different audiences. For local-focused businesses, we target Salthill and Galway residents with content emphasizing community connection, local benefits, and regular customer relationships. Tourism businesses target visitors with content highlighting unique experiences and coastal appeal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with seasonal promotions for Salthill businesses?",
      "answer": "Yes! We create seasonal campaign strategies – promoting summer activities during tourist season, highlighting indoor/cozy experiences in winter, and running special promotions during shoulder seasons to maintain steady business throughout the year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with Salthill influencers?",
      "answer": "Yes! We have relationships with Galway and Salthill influencers across various niches – food, lifestyle, fitness, tourism. We can identify relevant influencers for your brand, negotiate partnerships, and manage collaborations that expose your business to engaged local and visitor audiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will we see results from social media?",
      "answer": "You'll see engagement and follower growth within 1-3 months. Meaningful business impact (increased inquiries, bookings, foot traffic) typically develops over 3-6 months as we build an engaged community. Tourism businesses often see faster results during peak season."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we're a local business, not tourism-focused?",
      "answer": "Perfect! Social media works excellently for Salthill's local businesses too. We'll create content strategies targeting Salthill and Galway residents, build community engagement, and drive local awareness and loyalty that generates consistent business year-round."
