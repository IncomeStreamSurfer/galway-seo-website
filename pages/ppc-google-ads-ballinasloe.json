    },
    {
      "question": "What makes AI-powered optimization better than traditional PPC management?",
      "answer": "AI analyzes thousands of data points to identify patterns and optimization opportunities that humans might miss.

    {
      "question": "Will I have access to my Google Ads account and data?",
      "answer": "Yes, you maintain full ownership and access to your Google Ads account at all times. We manage it on your behalf but you're never locked out. You'll also receive 24/7 access to custom dashboards showing real-time performance, plus comprehensive monthly reports."

      "question": "Can you help with landing page creation for my campaigns?",
      "answer": "Definitely! High-converting landing pages are essential for Google Ads success. We design and develop custom landing pages optimized specifically for your Ballinasloe campaigns, ensuring message consistency from ad to landing page and maximum conversion rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require long-term contracts?",
      "answer": "No, Galway AI SEO works on flexible month-to-month agreements. While we recommend at least 3-6 months for campaigns to fully optimize and deliver best results, you're never locked into a long-term contract. We earn your business through consistent performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my current Google Ads aren't performing well?",
      "answer": "We offer free PPC audits to diagnose underperforming campaigns.

We can take over management and typically improve performance significantly within the first 30-60 days."
