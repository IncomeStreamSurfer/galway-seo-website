  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much should my Tuam business invest in Google Ads?",
      "answer": "For most Tuam businesses, €1,000-€2,000 per month (€35-65/day) generates consistent lead flow. Retail businesses might start around €1,000/month, service providers €1,200-€2,000/month, and competitive industries €2,000-€4,000/month. We'll provide specific recommendations based on your industry, competition, and goals during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target specific areas within North Galway?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We use advanced location targeting to focus ads on Tuam town, specific surrounding areas (Headford, Dunmore, Claregalway), or a custom radius around your business. You can also target multiple locations or all of North Galway. This ensures your budget reaches customers in your exact service area."
    },
    {
      "question": "How fast will I see results from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads delivers immediate visibility—you can appear at the top of search results within 24 hours. Many Tuam businesses see initial leads within the first week. Optimal performance develops over 4-8 weeks as we gather data and refine campaigns, but results come far faster than SEO's 3-6+ month timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your service different from other agencies?",
      "answer": "We're a certified Google Partner agency with specific North Galway market knowledge. We understand Tuam's business environment, local competition, and customer behavior. This combination of technical PPC expertise and local insight delivers campaigns specifically optimized for the Tuam market, not generic approaches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help my business compete with larger companies?",
      "answer": "Yes! Local businesses have unique advantages. We use geo-targeting to compete locally (not nationwide where budgets are higher), emphasize your Tuam presence in ad copy, target long-tail keywords, and highlight local benefits. Strategic targeting helps smaller Tuam businesses compete effectively against larger competitors."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you track phone calls from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "We implement call tracking that assigns unique phone numbers to your ads, showing exactly which keywords and campaigns generated each call. You'll see how many calls came from Google Ads, what customers searched for, call duration, and ROI. Critical for service businesses where phone leads are primary conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if Google Ads don't work for my business?",
      "answer": "Google Ads works for almost every business type if managed correctly. During our free audit, we assess viability for your specific business and industry. If we don't think Google Ads is right for you, we'll honestly tell you and suggest better alternatives. Our goal is your success, not just selling services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you provide regular reports showing results?",
      "answer": "Yes! You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing all key metrics: impressions, clicks, conversions, cost per conversion, ROI, and business impact. Reports are clear and transparent—no jargon or confusing data. We also hold regular strategy calls to review performance and discuss optimization opportunities."
