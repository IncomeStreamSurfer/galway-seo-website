Unlike paid ads that stop when you stop paying, quality content delivers compounding returns over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much content should we publish each month?",
      "answer": "Most businesses see excellent results with 3-5 high-quality blog posts per month plus regular social media content. The key is consistency and quality rather than volume. We'll recommend the optimal publishing frequency during your consultation based on your industry, goals, and resources."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you create content that matches our brand personality?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We invest time upfront understanding your brand personality, values, and communication style.

You'll receive detailed monthly reports showing exactly how content is performing for your Clarinbridge business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can content marketing replace paid advertising?",
      "answer": "While content marketing shouldn't completely replace paid advertising, it can significantly reduce your reliance on it. Quality content provides sustainable organic traffic that doesn't disappear when you stop paying. Many of our Clarinbridge clients have reduced ad spending by 40-60% as their content marketing matures."
    },
    {
      "question": "What types of content do you create besides blog posts?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How long until content marketing delivers ROI?",
      "answer": "Most businesses start seeing increased traffic within 2-3 months, with meaningful lead generation and ROI by 6-12 months. Content marketing is a long-term investment, but the results compound over time. Unlike paid ads, your content continues working and delivering value long after creation."
