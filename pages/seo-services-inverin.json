  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Do you offer bilingual SEO for Irish and English?",
      "answer": "Yes! We provide bilingual SEO optimization for businesses serving both Irish-speaking Gaeltacht customers and English-speaking tourists or regional customers. We create content in both languages, optimize for keywords in both languages, and implement proper technical language tagging to maximize visibility across all audiences for your Inverin business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can SEO help my Inverin tourism business?",
      "answer": "SEO helps you appear when tourists search for Connemara attractions, Gaeltacht experiences, accommodations, restaurants, and activities. By ranking for relevant tourism and cultural keywords, you capture travelers during the planning phase, often before they book with competitors. This drives more website visits, inquiries, and bookings for your Inverin business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does SEO take for Inverin businesses?",
      "answer": "Most businesses see initial ranking improvements within 3-6 months, with substantial growth by the following tourism season. Starting SEO 6-9 months before peak season allows you to capture travelers during their planning phase. Results compound over time - each year builds on previous success for your Inverin business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I target local customers or tourists?",
      "answer": "Most Inverin businesses benefit from targeting both! We create strategies capturing local Gaeltacht searches, regional Connemara queries, and tourist searches from people planning visits. The optimal balance depends on your business model - we analyze your revenue sources and adjust accordingly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle seasonal tourism demand?",
      "answer": "We optimize year-round while intensifying efforts before and during peak season. Content targets both immediate bookings and future trip planning. We identify off-season opportunities to maintain visibility, capture early bookings, and serve year-round local customers in Inverin and the Gaeltacht."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should an Inverin business invest in SEO?",
      "answer": "Investment varies based on business size and goals. Small businesses often start at €1,200-€2,000/month for local optimization, while tourism operations and businesses requiring bilingual content may invest €2,800-€3,800/month for comprehensive campaigns. We provide custom proposals based on your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can SEO help during off-season months?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Off-season SEO maintains visibility for early planners, captures different audience segments (locals, off-season travelers, cultural tourists), and is the ideal time for technical improvements and content development. This ensures you're ready when peak tourism season arrives for your Inverin business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success for Inverin businesses?",
      "answer": "We track keyword rankings (Irish and English), organic traffic, geographic visitor data, language preferences, inquiry submissions, booking conversions, and seasonal trends. Reports segment performance by audience type (local vs tourist, Irish vs English speakers) so you understand exactly how SEO drives results for your Inverin business."
