    {
      "question": "What exactly is marketing automation and why does my Loughrea business need it?",
      "answer": "Marketing automation uses software to automate repetitive marketing tasks like email campaigns, social media posts, and lead nurturing. For Loughrea businesses, this means you can engage prospects 24/7, deliver personalized experiences at scale, and significantly improve conversion rates—typically by 30-45%—while saving your team countless hours."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which marketing processes should we automate first?",
      "answer": "We typically start with email nurturing campaigns, welcome sequences, and lead scoring—the highest-impact, quickest-to-implement workflows. From there, we expand to abandoned cart recovery, customer onboarding, re-engagement campaigns, and more sophisticated multi-channel automation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What platforms do you recommend for marketing automation?",
      "answer": "We're platform-agnostic and recommend solutions based on your specific needs.
