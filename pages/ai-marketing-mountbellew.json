    },
    {
      "question": "What if we don't have much historical data?",
      "answer": "AI can still provide significant value! We supplement your data with industry benchmarks and best practices to train initial models. As your AI systems interact with customers, they quickly build your unique data set. Even businesses starting with limited data see benefits that improve rapidly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can we start small and expand AI capabilities later?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Many Mountbellew businesses start with a single AI feature like a chatbot or automated email sequences, then expand as they see results. There's no obligation to implement everything at once. We're happy to build your AI capabilities at a pace that suits your business and budget."
