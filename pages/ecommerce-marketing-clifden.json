  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Can e-commerce work for tourism-related businesses in Clifden?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! E-commerce is perfect for tourism businesses – selling experiences, tours, accommodations, local products, and gift items online. We help Clifden tourism businesses reach customers before they arrive, during their visit, and long after they've left Connemara through strategic online marketing."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I compete with large online retailers?",
      "answer": "Your advantage is authenticity, specialization, and local character. We help you showcase what makes your Clifden business unique – whether that's handcrafted products, local expertise, or personalized service. Combined with smart marketing, this allows you to dominate specific niches rather than competing broadly."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the best platform for my e-commerce store?",
      "answer": "For most Clifden businesses, we recommend Shopify for its ease of use, powerful features, and reliability. However, we also work with WooCommerce, BigCommerce, and custom solutions. We'll assess your specific needs and recommend the platform that best fits your products, budget, and technical comfort level."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to build an e-commerce store?",
      "answer": "A professional e-commerce store typically takes 4-8 weeks to build, depending on complexity. This includes platform setup, design, product catalog creation, payment and shipping configuration, and testing. We can launch faster for simpler stores or take additional time for complex custom requirements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with international shipping and sales?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many Clifden businesses sell internationally, and we have extensive experience with multi-currency setup, international shipping strategies, customs considerations, and global marketing campaigns. We can help you expand from local sales to serving customers worldwide."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about product photography for my online store?",
      "answer": "Professional product photography is crucial for e-commerce success. We can provide product photography services or connect you with skilled photographers in the Galway area. We'll ensure your products are presented beautifully and professionally to maximize conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle seasonal businesses?",
      "answer": "Many Clifden businesses are seasonal, and we specialize in seasonal e-commerce strategies. We'll help you maximize peak season sales while maintaining presence year-round, building your email list during off-season, and creating pre-season campaigns to drive early bookings or sales."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of ongoing support do you provide?",
      "answer": "We provide continuous campaign management, performance monitoring, monthly reporting, regular strategy calls, technical support, and ongoing optimization. E-commerce requires constant attention and adaptation, and we're committed to your long-term success."
