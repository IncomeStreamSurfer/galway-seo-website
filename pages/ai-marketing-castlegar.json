  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What exactly is AI-powered marketing?",
      "answer": "AI-powered marketing uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate, optimize, and personalize your marketing efforts. This includes chatbots that engage customers 24/7, predictive analytics that forecast trends, automated content creation, intelligent ad optimization, and smart customer segmentation. It's about using technology to work smarter, not harder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is AI marketing suitable for small businesses in Castlegar?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! AI marketing is no longer just for enterprise companies. We've designed accessible AI solutions specifically for small and medium businesses in Castlegar. Even basic AI implementations like chatbots and automated email sequences can deliver significant ROI. We scale solutions to fit your budget and grow with your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results from AI marketing?",
      "answer": "Many AI solutions deliver immediate benefits—chatbots start engaging customers from day one, and automated campaigns begin optimizing right away. However, AI gets smarter over time as it learns from your data. Most Castlegar businesses see measurable improvements within 30-60 days, with results continuing to improve over 6-12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will AI replace my marketing team?",
      "answer": "No! AI augments your team, not replaces them. Think of AI as a super-powered assistant that handles repetitive tasks, data analysis, and optimization, freeing your team to focus on strategy, creativity, and relationship building. Many of our Castlegar clients find their teams become more effective and productive with AI support."

Your customer data is encrypted, securely stored, and never shared with third parties. We follow strict data protection protocols to ensure your Castlegar business and customers are fully protected."
    },
    {
      "question": "What AI tools and platforms do you use?",
      "answer": "We work with leading AI marketing platforms including HubSpot AI, Salesforce Einstein, Google AI, ChatGPT for content, and custom machine learning models. We select the best tools based on your specific needs, ensuring everything integrates seamlessly with your existing marketing stack."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help us implement just one AI feature to start?",
      "answer": "Yes! Many Castlegar businesses start with a single AI feature like a chatbot or automated email sequences, then expand as they see results. We're happy to start small and scale up. There's no obligation to implement everything at once—we build your AI capabilities at a pace that works for you."
