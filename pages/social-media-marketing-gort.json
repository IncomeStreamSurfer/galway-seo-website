  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How will social media marketing benefit my Gort business?",
      "answer": "Social media helps Gort businesses build local brand awareness, engage directly with customers, showcase your products or services, drive traffic to your location or website, generate leads, and increase sales. It's particularly effective for reaching younger demographics and building a loyal community around your brand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which social media platforms should we use?",
      "answer": "The best platforms depend on your target audience and business type. Most Gort businesses benefit from Facebook for community reach and Instagram for visual storytelling. LinkedIn is essential for B2B and professional services. TikTok works well for reaching younger audiences. We'll assess your specific needs and recommend the optimal platform strategy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time will social media marketing take?",
      "answer": "When you partner with Kraft Agency, social media requires minimal time from you. We handle all strategy, content creation, scheduling, posting, community management, advertising, and reporting. You simply review our monthly content calendar, provide feedback, and share any specific promotions or updates you'd like featured."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you create all the content for our accounts?",
      "answer": "Yes! Our team handles complete content creation including copywriting, graphic design, photography, and video production.

    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will we see results?",
      "answer": "You'll typically see increased engagement and follower growth within the first 1-2 months. More significant results like increased website traffic, lead generation, and revenue impact usually develop over 3-6 months as we build your audience, test strategies, and optimize performance. Social media delivers compound returns over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we invest in paid social media advertising?",
      "answer": "Paid advertising significantly accelerates results and allows precise targeting of your ideal customers in Gort and surrounding areas. While organic content builds community, paid ads drive specific actions like website visits, calls, or purchases. We typically recommend combining organic and paid strategies for optimal results and ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure the success of social media campaigns?",
      "answer": "We track metrics that matter to your Gort business: engagement rates, reach, follower growth, website traffic from social, lead generation, conversion rates, and ROI. Monthly reports show exactly how social media contributes to your business goals with clear insights and recommendations for continued improvement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you take over our existing social media accounts?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We can seamlessly assume management of your existing accounts on any platform. We'll conduct a comprehensive audit, optimize your profiles, develop an improved strategy, and begin implementing our approach. Many Gort businesses come to us with underperforming accounts that we transform into powerful growth tools."
