    },
    {
      "question": "What e-commerce platform do you recommend for Tuam businesses?",
      "answer": "We typically recommend Shopify for most Tuam businesses due to its reliability, ease of use, mobile optimization, comprehensive features, and excellent support.

    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to build and launch an e-commerce store?",
      "answer": "Most Shopify stores take 4-6 weeks from initial consultation to launch, including strategy, design, development, product setup, payment integration, and testing. More complex stores with custom features may take 8-10 weeks. We can work with accelerated timelines for urgent Tuam launches."

    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I invest in e-commerce marketing?",
      "answer": "Most successful Tuam e-commerce businesses invest €2,500-€7,000/month in marketing services plus advertising budget (typically €1,000-€3,000/month to start). Investment depends on your revenue goals, products, competition, and target markets. We create custom strategies for your specific business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with shipping and international sales?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We help you set up shipping options, integrate with carriers (An Post, DPD, etc.), configure international shipping, set up multi-currency support, and create localized checkout experiences. We can help your Tuam business sell across Ireland, EU, or worldwide."
    },
    {
      "question": "What results can I expect from e-commerce?",
      "answer": "Results vary by industry and competition, but our Tuam e-commerce clients typically see 20-40% increases in conversion rates, 50-100%+ increases in organic traffic within 6-12 months, and 3-5X return on ad spend. We focus on sustainable, profitable growth for long-term success."

      "question": "Do you provide ongoing e-commerce support?",
      "answer": "Yes! We offer comprehensive ongoing support including store maintenance, product updates, marketing campaign management, conversion optimization, technical support, and strategic guidance. Most Tuam clients work with us on monthly retainers for continuous optimization and growth."
