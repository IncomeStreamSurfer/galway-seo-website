  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long until my Kilronan business sees SEO results?",
      "answer": "SEO typically shows initial results within 2-4 months, with significant improvements by 6-12 months. The timeline varies based on your industry competition, current website status, and keyword difficulty. Unlike paid advertising, SEO builds momentum over time, with results compounding as your authority grows."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the ROI of SEO for Kilronan businesses?",
      "answer": "SEO typically delivers exceptional ROI compared to other marketing channels. While it requires upfront investment, organic traffic continues flowing without ongoing ad costs. Many of our Kilronan clients see 5-10x ROI within the first year, with returns increasing as rankings improve and authority builds."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you promise first page rankings?",
      "answer": "We can't ethically guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithm is complex and constantly evolving. However, we can promise our expertise, proven strategies, transparent communication, and relentless focus on driving measurable results that grow your Kilronan business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your SEO services unique?",
      "answer": "We combine 15+ years of SEO expertise with cutting-edge AI tools for superior insights and faster results. We provide complete transparency through detailed reporting, focus on metrics that drive business growth, and customize every strategy for your Kilronan business's specific needs and goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much should I invest in SEO?",
      "answer": "Investment depends on your goals, competition, and timeline. Kilronan businesses typically invest €1,200-€2,000/month for local SEO, or €3,000-€5,000/month for more competitive markets. We provide custom proposals based on your specific situation after conducting an initial audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer both local and national SEO?",
      "answer": "Yes! We create customized strategies whether you want to dominate local Kilronan searches, expand across Ireland, or target international markets. We'll recommend the best approach based on your business model, target audience, and growth objectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How often will you communicate with me?",
      "answer": "You'll receive comprehensive monthly reports detailing your SEO performance, and we schedule regular strategy calls (typically monthly) to discuss results, answer questions, and plan next steps. We're also available via email or phone for questions between scheduled meetings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I've tried SEO before without success?",
      "answer": "Many businesses have had poor experiences with low-quality SEO services. We take a different approach - comprehensive strategy, proven tactics, transparent reporting, and constant optimization. We'd be happy to review what was tried previously and explain how our approach differs."
