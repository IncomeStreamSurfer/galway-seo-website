  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does marketing automation actually work?",
      "answer": "Marketing automation uses software to automatically execute marketing tasks based on triggers and workflows you define. For example, when someone downloads your guide, they automatically receive a welcome email, then a series of educational emails, and sales outreach – all without manual effort. It's like having a marketing team that never sleeps."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tasks can be automated in my Oranmore business?",
      "answer": "Common automation includes email sequences, social media posting, lead scoring and routing, abandoned cart recovery, customer onboarding, appointment reminders, survey distribution, campaign reporting, and much more. If it's repetitive and rule-based, it can likely be automated."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will automation make my marketing feel impersonal?",
      "answer": "Quite the opposite! Good automation enables better personalization at scale. You can send targeted, relevant messages based on individual behavior, preferences, and lifecycle stage. Customers receive timely, helpful content that feels personalized because it is – you just didn't have to manually send each one."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time will marketing automation save my team?",
      "answer": "Most businesses save 15-30 hours per week on repetitive tasks. This frees your team to focus on strategy, creative work, and high-value activities. Plus, automation works 24/7, so you're nurturing leads and engaging customers even when your team is offline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is marketing automation expensive?",
      "answer": "Not when you consider the ROI. Platform costs range from €50-€500+ per month depending on your needs. Combined with implementation and management, total investment starts around €2,000-€3,000 per month. However, the time saved and revenue generated typically deliver 3-10x ROI within the first year."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can automation work for B2B companies in Oranmore?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! B2B marketing automation is particularly powerful for nurturing longer sales cycles, scoring leads, coordinating sales and marketing, and managing complex customer journeys. Many B2B companies see even higher ROI than B2C due to higher customer values."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if something goes wrong with my automation?",
      "answer": "We provide ongoing monitoring and support to prevent issues. Automation platforms have built-in safeguards, and we implement additional checks to ensure everything runs smoothly. If something does go wrong, we're available to troubleshoot and resolve issues quickly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure automation success?",
      "answer": "We track metrics like time saved, email engagement rates, lead conversion rates, revenue attributed to automation, customer lifetime value, and overall marketing ROI. You receive monthly reports showing exactly how automation is performing and contributing to your business goals."
