  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long before we see results from social media marketing?",
      "answer": "While some businesses see increased engagement within the first month, meaningful results typically appear within 3-6 months. Social media success requires consistency and patience. We focus on building authentic engagement and growing a quality audience in Athenry that converts into customers, not just chasing follower counts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can social media really help my Athenry business grow?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Social media is one of the most cost-effective marketing channels available. It helps you build brand awareness in Athenry, engage directly with customers, drive website traffic, generate leads, and increase sales. Our clients regularly see significant ROI from strategic social media marketing."
    },
    {
      "question": "What type of content performs best for local Athenry businesses?",
      "answer": "For Athenry businesses, content that showcases your local presence, community involvement, customer testimonials, behind-the-scenes looks, and educational content about your products or services performs exceptionally well. We create a strategic mix of content types to maximize engagement and conversions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do we need to be on every social media platform?",
      "answer": "No! It's better to excel on 2-3 platforms where your target audience is active than to spread yourself thin across every network. For most Athenry businesses, Facebook and Instagram are essential, with LinkedIn important for B2B companies. We'll help you choose the right platforms for your specific goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time do I need to spend on social media marketing?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Should we invest in paid social media advertising?",
      "answer": "Paid social advertising significantly amplifies your reach and results. While organic content builds community, paid ads target specific audiences, drive traffic, and generate leads faster. For Athenry businesses, we typically recommend combining organic and paid strategies for optimal results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes Galway AI SEO different from other social media agencies?",
      "answer": "We're based in Galway and understand the local Athenry market intimately. We combine this local insight with AI-powered analytics and proven creative strategies.

    },

      "answer": "Our creative team handles all aspects of content creation including copywriting, graphic design, video production, and photography.
