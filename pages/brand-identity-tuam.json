  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can strong branding help my Tuam business grow?",
      "answer": "Professional branding builds customer trust, differentiates you from competitors, supports premium pricing, and creates memorable customer experiences. Strong brands are more easily recognized, remembered, and chosen - driving sustainable business growth in Tuam and beyond."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes a brand identity strategic vs just a logo?",
      "answer": "Strategic brand identity includes positioning strategy, market research, competitive analysis, target audience insights, messaging framework, and visual identity - all working together to support business goals. A logo alone is just one visual element without the strategic foundation."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does the brand development process take?",
      "answer": "Most brand identity projects take 6-10 weeks from kickoff to delivery, including discovery, research, strategy, creative development, refinement, and deliverable preparation. We can adjust timelines to accommodate your specific launch needs or urgency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help our Tuam business appeal to wider markets?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We design brands that work for your target markets - whether that's local Tuam customers, regional North Galway audience, or national/international markets. Our research identifies opportunities to create broadly appealing brands with local authenticity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What industries do you have experience with?",
      "answer": "We've created brand identities across diverse sectors including retail, hospitality, professional services, manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, technology, and more. Our strategic approach works across industries because we focus on understanding your unique business and customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you help implement the brand after launch?",
      "answer": "Yes! We provide comprehensive implementation support including templates, guidelines, and consultation. We can also design specific brand applications like business cards, signage, website design, marketing materials, and more as your business needs them."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's your process for rebranding established businesses?",
      "answer": "Our rebrand process includes careful analysis of your current brand equity, what's working and what needs evolution. We develop strategic recommendations that honor your business heritage while modernizing your identity for future growth and improved market position."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do we maintain brand consistency after launch?",
      "answer": "We provide comprehensive brand guidelines documenting proper usage across all applications. These guidelines ensure anyone implementing your brand - whether internal staff or external partners - maintains consistency. We're also available for ongoing brand consultation."
