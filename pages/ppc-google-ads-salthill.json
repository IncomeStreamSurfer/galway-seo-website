  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How can Google Ads help my Salthill tourism business?",
      "answer": "Google Ads puts your hotel, restaurant, or tourist attraction at the top of search results when travelers are planning their Galway Bay visit. We target high-intent keywords like 'hotels Salthill', 'restaurants Salthill Promenade', and 'things to do Salthill' to capture tourists ready to book, driving immediate bookings and revenue."
    },
    {
      "question": "What budget do I need for tourism Google Ads in Salthill?",
      "answer": "Tourism and hospitality campaigns in Salthill typically require €1,500-€5,000+ monthly ad spend to compete effectively, especially during peak season. The high value of bookings and tourist spending justifies these budgets. We'll recommend an appropriate budget based on your business type and goals during your free audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you adjust campaigns for tourism seasonality?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Seasonal optimization is crucial for Salthill tourism businesses. We increase budgets and bids during peak tourism months (May-September), major events, and holidays, then scale back during quieter periods to maximize efficiency. We can also promote shoulder-season offers to extend your tourism revenue."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you target both tourists and local Salthill customers?",
      "answer": "Yes! We create separate campaign strategies for tourists (searching for 'Salthill hotels', 'Galway Bay restaurants') and local residents (searching for 'restaurants near me', 'Salthill services'). This ensures relevant messaging for each audience type."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you track bookings from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "We implement comprehensive conversion tracking for all booking methods—online reservations, phone calls, booking form submissions, and even directions requests. You'll see exactly how many bookings Google Ads generates and the ROI on your ad spend."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads drive last-minute bookings?",
      "answer": "Yes! Mobile Google Ads are perfect for capturing tourists already in Galway searching for last-minute accommodations, restaurants, or activities. We optimize for mobile devices and use location-based targeting to reach tourists in real-time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I compete with large hotel chains in Salthill?",
      "answer": "Smart campaign structure and targeting let smaller Salthill businesses compete effectively. We focus on niche keywords, local terms, long-tail searches, and highlight your unique advantages (boutique service, Irish hospitality, personal touch) that larger chains can't match."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Google Ads compare to OTA listings like Booking.com?",
      "answer": "Google Ads drive direct bookings to your website, avoiding high OTA commission fees (15-25%). While OTAs have their place, Google Ads help build direct customer relationships and keep more revenue. Many successful Salthill businesses use both channels strategically."
