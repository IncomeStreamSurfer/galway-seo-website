  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What exactly is marketing automation?",
      "answer": "Marketing automation uses software to automate repetitive marketing tasks like email campaigns, social media posting, ad management, and lead nurturing. It allows you to deliver personalized, timely messages to prospects and customers at scale, without manual effort for each interaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can marketing automation help my Galway business?",
      "answer": "Marketing automation saves time, increases efficiency, improves lead nurturing, boosts conversion rates, and provides better customer experiences. You can nurture more leads with less effort, respond to customer actions instantly, and scale your marketing without proportionally scaling your team."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the ROI of marketing automation?",
      "answer": "Most businesses see 10-30% improvement in conversion rates and 20-50% reduction in marketing workload within the first year. Marketing automation also improves lead quality, shortens sales cycles, and increases customer lifetime value. ROI typically becomes positive within 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which marketing automation platform should I use?",
      "answer": "It depends on your business size, budget, and needs. We typically recommend HubSpot for comprehensive all-in-one solutions, ActiveCampaign for small to medium businesses, Klaviyo for e-commerce, and Marketo for enterprise. We'll assess your situation and recommend the best fit."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is marketing automation only for large companies?",

    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to implement marketing automation?",
      "answer": "Basic automation can be set up in 2-4 weeks. Comprehensive automation with multiple workflows, integrations, and advanced features typically takes 6-12 weeks. We prioritize quick wins first, then build out more sophisticated automation over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will marketing automation integrate with my existing tools?",
      "answer": "Yes! Modern automation platforms integrate with virtually all business tools including CRMs, email platforms, websites, e-commerce systems, advertising platforms, and analytics tools. We handle all technical integration to ensure everything works seamlessly together."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I still need a marketing team with automation?",
      "answer": "Yes, but automation makes your team far more effective. Automation handles repetitive tasks, allowing your team to focus on strategy, creative work, and relationship building. Think of automation as a force multiplier that amplifies your team's impact."
