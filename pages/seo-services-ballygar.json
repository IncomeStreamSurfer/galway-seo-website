  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see SEO results in Ballygar?",
      "answer": "Most Ballygar businesses start seeing improved rankings within 3-6 months, with significant traffic increases by 6-12 months. SEO is a long-term investment that builds sustainable organic growth. We provide regular progress reports so you can track improvements in rankings, traffic, and conversions throughout the journey."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between local and national SEO?",
      "answer": "Local SEO focuses on ranking for location-specific searches like 'services in Ballygar' or 'near me' queries - ideal for businesses serving Ballygar and County Galway. National SEO targets broader keywords across Ireland. For most Ballygar businesses, local SEO delivers the highest ROI by connecting you with nearby customers ready to buy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost for a Ballygar business?",
      "answer": "SEO investment varies based on your goals, industry competition, and current website status. Local SEO campaigns for Ballygar businesses typically start from €1,200/month, while competitive county-wide or national campaigns may be €3,000-€10,000/month. We provide custom quotes after conducting a free initial audit of your website."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you guarantee first page rankings on Google?",
      "answer": "While we can't ethically guarantee specific rankings (Google's algorithm changes constantly and no one controls it), we do guarantee our commitment to best practices and continuous optimization. Our track record speaks for itself - most clients achieve first-page rankings for their target keywords within 6-12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your SEO services for Ballygar?",

Everything needed to dominate search in Ballygar."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you only use white-hat SEO techniques?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We exclusively use white-hat, Google-approved SEO techniques that build sustainable long-term success. Black-hat tactics might offer short-term gains but risk severe penalties that can devastate your online presence. We build SEO strategies that last and grow stronger over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success?",

We handle research, writing, optimization, and publishing so you can focus on running your Ballygar business."
