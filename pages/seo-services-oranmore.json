  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does SEO take to work for my Oranmore business?",
      "answer": "Most Oranmore businesses start seeing improved rankings within 2-4 months, with significant results by 6-9 months. Local searches like 'plumber Oranmore' often show results faster than competitive national keywords."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's local SEO and do I need it?",
      "answer": "Local SEO helps your Oranmore business appear when people search for services 'near me' or in 'Oranmore'. If you serve local customers, it's essential. We optimize your Google Business Profile so you appear in map results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost?",
      "answer": "SEO for Oranmore businesses typically starts from €1,200 per month for local campaigns. Cost depends on your competition and goals. We provide clear pricing and flexible month-to-month contracts."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your SEO service?",
      "answer": "We include website optimization, content creation, local SEO, Google Business Profile management, keyword research, technical fixes, and monthly reporting. Everything you need to rank higher in Oranmore searches."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will SEO work for my type of business?",
      "answer": "SEO works for virtually any business that customers search for online. We work with Oranmore retailers, restaurants, tradespeople, professional services, and more. If people Google your service, SEO can help."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a new website for SEO?",
      "answer": "Not necessarily. We can optimize most existing websites. During our audit, we'll identify if improvements are needed or if a new website would be more cost-effective long-term."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know if SEO is working?",
      "answer": "You'll receive monthly reports showing your keyword rankings, website traffic, and inquiries from SEO. Most Oranmore businesses notice more phone calls and website visitors within a few months."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between SEO and Google Ads?",
      "answer": "SEO gets you free organic traffic by ranking naturally on Google, but takes time to build. Google Ads delivers immediate results but requires ongoing ad spend. We recommend both for fastest results."
