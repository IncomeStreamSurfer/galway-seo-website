  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much should I budget for Google Ads in Clarinbridge?",
      "answer": "For local Clarinbridge businesses, we typically recommend starting with €500-€1,000 per month in ad spend, plus management fees of €750+. This budget allows for effective testing and optimization while reaching qualified local customers. Larger businesses targeting regional or national audiences may invest €2,000-€10,000+ monthly."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Unlike SEO, Google Ads delivers immediate visibility – your ads can start appearing within hours of launch. However, optimal performance typically develops over 4-8 weeks as we gather data, test variations, and refine targeting. Most Clarinbridge clients see positive ROI within the first 2-3 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with businesses outside of Clarinbridge?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While we're proud to serve Clarinbridge businesses, Galway AI SEO works with clients throughout County Galway and across Ireland. Our Google Ads expertise applies whether you're targeting local Clarinbridge customers or national audiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your Google Ads service different from others?",
      "answer": "Our AI-powered optimization sets us apart. We use advanced machine learning tools to analyze performance data and make intelligent bidding adjustments that maximize ROI. Combined with our Google Partner certification and transparent reporting, you get cutting-edge PPC management with full visibility."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with landing page creation for my ads?",
      "answer": "Yes! High-converting landing pages are crucial for Google Ads success. We design and develop custom landing pages optimized specifically for your Clarinbridge campaigns, ensuring message consistency and maximum conversion rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a long-term contract for Google Ads management?",
      "answer": "No, Galway AI SEO operates on flexible month-to-month agreements. We believe in earning your business through results, not locking you into long contracts. While we recommend at least 3-6 months for optimal campaign development, you're free to adjust or cancel anytime."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure and report on campaign performance?",
      "answer": "We provide comprehensive monthly reports showing all key metrics: impressions, clicks, conversions, cost per acquisition, ROI, and more. You'll have 24/7 access to live dashboards showing real-time performance, and we schedule monthly strategy calls to review results and plan improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my Google Ads campaigns aren't performing well?",
      "answer": "We continuously monitor and optimize campaigns to ensure strong performance. If results aren't meeting expectations, we quickly identify issues and implement solutions. Our data-driven approach means we catch and fix problems early, and we're always transparent about performance and our optimization strategy."
