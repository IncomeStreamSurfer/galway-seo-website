  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to see SEO results in Galway City?",
      "answer": "Most Galway City clients start seeing improved rankings within 3-6 months, with significant traffic increases by 6-12 months. Competitive keywords may take longer, but local Galway searches often show results faster. SEO is a long-term investment with sustainable results."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between local and national SEO?",
      "answer": "Local SEO focuses on ranking for location-specific searches like 'dentist Galway City' or 'restaurant Salthill', ideal for businesses serving specific areas. National SEO targets broader keywords across Ireland. Most Galway businesses benefit from a local-first approach."
    },
    {
      "question": "How competitive is SEO in Galway City?",
      "answer": "Galway City is moderately competitive depending on your industry. Tourism, hospitality, and professional services are highly competitive, while niche B2B services face less competition. We conduct thorough competitor analysis to develop winning strategies."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you guarantee first page rankings?",
      "answer": "While we can't ethically guarantee specific rankings (Google's algorithm changes constantly), we do guarantee our commitment to best practices and continuous optimization. Most Galway City clients achieve first-page rankings for their target keywords within 6-12 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost for Galway businesses?",
      "answer": "SEO investment varies based on your goals, industry competition, and current website status. Local Galway City campaigns typically start from €1,500/month, while competitive national campaigns may be €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide custom quotes after our initial audit."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your Galway SEO services?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive SEO includes technical optimization, keyword research, content strategy and creation, on-page optimization, link building, local SEO (Google Business Profile optimization), competitor analysis, and detailed monthly reporting with strategy calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with Google Business Profile optimization?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) optimization is crucial for local Galway City businesses. We optimize your profile, manage reviews, and ensure you appear in local map results for relevant searches."
    },
