  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How does local SEO work for Furbo businesses?",
      "answer": "Local SEO optimizes your online presence for location-based searches like 'business near Furbo' or 'service in Galway'. We optimize your Google Business Profile, build local citations, create location-specific content, and earn local backlinks to dominate search results when Furbo and Galway customers search for your services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I target just Furbo or broader Galway?",
      "answer": "Most Furbo businesses benefit from targeting both! We optimize for specific Furbo searches while also capturing customers from Galway City, Salthill, Spiddal, and the broader region. This maximizes your visibility across your entire service area, driving more qualified traffic to your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly can my Furbo business see local SEO results?",
      "answer": "Local SEO often shows results faster than national SEO. Many businesses see improved local rankings within 2-4 months, with substantial traffic increases by 6-9 months. The timeline depends on your industry competition in the Furbo/Galway area and your current online presence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between regular SEO and local SEO?",
      "answer": "Local SEO focuses on location-based searches and includes optimization of Google Business Profile, local citations, location-specific content, and local link building. Regular SEO targets broader keywords without geographic focus. Most Furbo businesses need strong local SEO to capture nearby customers."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does local SEO cost for Furbo businesses?",
      "answer": "Local SEO for Furbo businesses typically starts at €1,200-€1,800/month for focused local optimization, ranging to €2,500-€3,500/month for comprehensive campaigns covering the greater Galway area. We provide custom proposals based on your specific industry, competition, and service area."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need a Google Business Profile?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Your Google Business Profile is crucial for local SEO. It helps you appear in Google Maps, local pack results, and location-based searches. We optimize your profile as part of our local SEO service, ensuring maximum visibility for your Furbo business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can SEO help if most of my customers are from Galway City?",
      "answer": "Yes! We create strategies targeting multiple locations - Furbo for hyperlocal searches and Galway City for the larger market. This ensures you capture customers regardless of how they search, whether they specify Furbo, Galway, or just search for your service type."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure local SEO success?",
      "answer": "We track local keyword rankings, Google Business Profile visibility, website traffic by location, direction requests, phone calls, form submissions, and conversion rates. Monthly reports segment performance by location (Furbo, Galway, regional) so you see exactly where your customers are coming from."
