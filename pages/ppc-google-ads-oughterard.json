  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How much does Google Ads cost for an Oughterard business?",
      "answer": "Total investment includes management fees (typically €750+ per month) plus your ad spend budget. We recommend €500-€1,000 monthly ad spend for local Oughterard campaigns. Tourism and hospitality businesses may benefit from larger budgets of €2,000-€5,000+ during peak season to maximize reach."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads help my tourism business in Oughterard?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Oughterard's position as the Gateway to Connemara makes it ideal for tourism-focused Google Ads. We can target visitors searching for accommodation, activities, and services in the area with seasonal campaigns optimized for peak tourist months. Many of our Oughterard clients are in tourism and hospitality."
    },
    {
      "question": "How quickly will I see results from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Your ads can start appearing immediately after launch, generating traffic within hours. However, optimal performance develops over 4-8 weeks as we collect data and refine targeting. Most Oughterard businesses see positive ROI within 2-3 months as campaigns mature."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with businesses outside of Oughterard?",
      "answer": "Yes! While we have deep expertise in the Oughterard and Connemara market, we serve businesses throughout County Galway and across Ireland. Our Google Ads strategies work for local, regional, national, and international targeting."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your Google Ads service better than doing it myself?",
      "answer": "Google Ads looks simple but requires deep expertise to execute profitably. Our specialists bring 15+ years of experience, Google Partner certification, AI-powered optimization tools, and proven strategies that most businesses can't replicate in-house. We typically improve ROI by 50-300% compared to self-managed campaigns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I own my Google Ads account?",
      "answer": "Yes, you maintain full ownership and access to your Google Ads account at all times. We manage it on your behalf, but you're never locked out. You'll also receive comprehensive monthly reports and have 24/7 access to custom performance dashboards."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with landing page creation for my ads?",
      "answer": "Definitely! High-converting landing pages are crucial for Google Ads success. We design and build custom landing pages optimized specifically for your Oughterard campaigns, ensuring message consistency and maximum conversion rates."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if my campaigns aren't performing well?",
      "answer": "We continuously monitor and optimize all campaigns. If performance isn't meeting expectations, we quickly diagnose issues and implement solutions. Our AI-powered tools help us identify and fix problems faster than traditional management. We're fully transparent about performance and always working to improve results."
