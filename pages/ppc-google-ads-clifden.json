  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What should Clifden tourism businesses budget for Google Ads?",
      "answer": "We recommend aggressive budgets during peak season (May-September): €2,000-€8,000+ monthly to maximize visibility when visitor demand is highest. Off-season budgets can reduce to €500-€1,500 to maintain presence and capture early planners. Investment scales with business size and booking value."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can Google Ads help my Clifden hotel or B&B get more bookings?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Google Ads is highly effective for accommodation in Clifden. We target high-intent searches like 'hotels Clifden', 'accommodation Connemara', 'where to stay Sky Road' and similar keywords that capture visitors actively planning trips. Many clients see bookings within days of launch."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle seasonal fluctuations in Clifden?",
      "answer": "We create flexible seasonal strategies – ramping up budgets and aggressive bidding during peak months (May-September), maintaining strategic presence during shoulder seasons to capture early bookers, and running minimal campaigns in winter focused on next-season planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Should I advertise during winter months in Clifden?",
      "answer": "It depends on your business. Tourism businesses benefit from year-round presence at reduced budgets to capture early planners. Local services should maintain consistent campaigns. We can adjust strategies monthly based on your specific needs and budget."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you target specific countries for tourism marketing?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can geo-target specific countries where your visitors originate – UK, US, Germany, France, etc. This ensures your ads appear to people in those markets searching for Clifden and Connemara travel, maximizing relevance and ROI."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm a local business, not tourism-focused?",
      "answer": "We work with all business types in Clifden! Local services, retail shops, and professional services benefit from Google Ads targeting residents and nearby communities. Your campaigns would focus on different keywords and audiences than tourism businesses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require annual contracts?",
      "answer": "No, we operate on flexible month-to-month agreements. This is perfect for seasonal Clifden businesses – scale up during peak season, reduce or pause during quiet periods without penalties or long-term commitments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will you create booking-optimized landing pages?",
      "answer": "Yes! For tourism businesses, we create landing pages specifically designed to convert visitors into bookings – showcasing your Clifden location, proximity to attractions, amenities, reviews, and simple booking processes that maximize conversion rates."
