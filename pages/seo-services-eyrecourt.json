  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How soon can my Eyrecourt business see SEO results?",
      "answer": "Most businesses begin seeing ranking improvements within 2-4 months, with substantial traffic growth typically occurring between 6-12 months. The timeline depends on your industry competition, current website status, and the competitiveness of your target keywords. We provide monthly progress reports to track improvements."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does SEO take several months to work?",
      "answer": "SEO is a long-term strategy because Google evaluates hundreds of factors before changing rankings. It takes time for Google to discover changes, evaluate content quality, and verify your site's authority through backlinks. However, once established, organic rankings provide sustainable traffic for your Eyrecourt business."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you guarantee my Eyrecourt business will rank #1?",
      "answer": "Ethical SEO agencies cannot guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithm involves over 200 factors that constantly evolve. We guarantee our commitment to proven strategies, transparent reporting, and continuous optimization focused on driving traffic and revenue growth for your Eyrecourt business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your SEO service?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive SEO service includes technical optimization, keyword research and targeting, content strategy and creation, on-page optimization, strategic link building, local SEO setup, competitor monitoring, monthly performance reporting, and regular strategy consultations tailored to your Eyrecourt business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost for an Eyrecourt business?",
      "answer": "SEO investment varies based on your goals, industry competition, and current website status. Local campaigns for Eyrecourt businesses typically start at €1,200-€2,000/month, while more competitive strategies may require €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide custom proposals after reviewing your specific situation."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to sign a long-term contract?",
      "answer": "No. We operate on a monthly basis with no long-term contracts. While SEO works best as a sustained strategy (6-12+ months), you maintain flexibility to adjust or pause services. We believe our results should earn your continued partnership."
    },

      "answer": "Our team actively monitors industry news, participates in SEO communities, attends conferences, and analyzes algorithm updates as they occur. We adapt our strategies based on proven best practices and real-world testing to ensure your Eyrecourt business stays ahead of changes."
