  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What's the minimum budget needed for Google Ads in Moycullen?",
      "answer": "We recommend starting with at least €500-€1,000 per month in ad spend for local Moycullen campaigns, plus management fees. This provides enough data to optimize effectively while reaching qualified local customers. Smaller budgets can work but may limit reach and testing capabilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long before I see results from my Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Your ads can appear within hours of launch, generating immediate traffic. However, optimal performance typically develops over 4-8 weeks as we collect data and refine targeting. Most Moycullen clients see positive ROI within 2-3 months as campaigns mature and optimize."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you only serve businesses in Moycullen?",
      "answer": "No, we serve businesses throughout County Galway and all of Ireland. While we have deep local expertise in the Moycullen market, our Google Ads capabilities extend to clients targeting local, regional, national, or even international audiences."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes AI-powered PPC better than traditional management?",
      "answer": "AI analyzes thousands of data points to identify optimization opportunities humans might miss. It can adjust bids in real-time based on conversion likelihood, test ad variations faster, and predict performance trends. This results in better ROI, lower cost per acquisition, and faster optimization."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will I have access to my Google Ads account and data?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! You maintain ownership of your Google Ads account and have full access at all times. We also provide 24/7 access to custom dashboards showing real-time performance metrics, plus comprehensive monthly reports and regular strategy calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I'm already running Google Ads but not seeing results?",
      "answer": "We offer free PPC audits to identify what's not working in your current campaigns. Common issues include poor keyword targeting, weak ad copy, unoptimized landing pages, or inadequate conversion tracking. We can take over management and implement fixes to dramatically improve performance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help with both Google Ads and other platforms like Facebook Ads?",
      "answer": "Yes! While Google Ads is often the primary focus for Moycullen businesses, we manage multi-channel PPC campaigns including Facebook Ads, Instagram Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and more. We can recommend the best platform mix based on your target audience and business goals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you require long-term contracts?",
      "answer": "No, Kraft Agency operates on flexible month-to-month agreements. While we recommend at least 3-6 months for campaigns to fully optimize, you're never locked in. We believe in earning your continued business through consistent results and exceptional service."
