  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why is social media important for my Tuam business?",
      "answer": "Social media allows you to connect directly with Tuam customers where they spend their time online. It builds brand awareness, establishes your expertise, drives traffic to your website or store, generates leads, and provides a platform for customer service. For local businesses, it's essential for staying competitive and top-of-mind with your community."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you create content that resonates with Tuam customers?",

      "answer": "Absolutely! We specialize in creating and managing paid social media campaigns that target specific demographics, interests, and locations including Tuam and surrounding areas. Our campaigns are designed to maximize ROI through strategic targeting, compelling creative, and continuous optimization based on performance data."
    },
    {
      "question": "What makes your approach different from DIY social media?",
      "answer": "While anyone can post on social media, effective social media marketing requires strategy, consistency, creative skills, and ongoing optimization. We bring expertise in content creation, audience targeting, platform algorithms, paid advertising, analytics, and crisis management.

      "answer": "We monitor your social channels daily and respond to all feedback professionally and constructively. For negative comments, we follow a protocol that acknowledges concerns, offers solutions, and takes sensitive discussions private when appropriate. Our goal is to protect your reputation while showing your commitment to customer satisfaction."
    },
    {
      "question": "What content types work best for Tuam businesses?",
      "answer": "The best content mix varies by business, but successful Tuam businesses typically use behind-the-scenes content, customer testimonials, educational posts about products/services, local event coverage, community highlights, promotional offers, and user-generated content. We create a diverse content strategy that keeps your audience engaged and drives business results."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long until we see results from social media marketing?",
      "answer": "You'll typically see increased engagement and follower growth within the first 1-2 months. More significant results like website traffic increases, lead generation, and sales growth usually develop over 3-6 months as we build your audience and optimize strategy. Social media is a long-term investment that compounds over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you take over our existing social media accounts?",
      "answer": "Yes! We can seamlessly take over management of your existing Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, and other social accounts. We'll conduct an initial audit, optimize your profiles, develop a new strategy, and begin implementing improved content and engagement practices immediately to enhance your Tuam business presence."
