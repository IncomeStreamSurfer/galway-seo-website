  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "Why should I choose a local Oranmore agency for social media?",
      "answer": "As an Oranmore-based agency, we understand the local market intimately and can respond quickly to opportunities. We can easily meet in person, understand local events and culture that make great content, and provide personalized service you won't get from distant agencies. Plus, we're invested in Oranmore's business community."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much time does social media marketing take?",
      "answer": "Done properly, social media requires significant time for content creation, community management, and strategy. That's why most Oranmore businesses outsource to specialists like us. We handle everything – strategy, content creation, posting, engagement, and reporting – so you can focus on running your business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What results can we expect from social media marketing?",
      "answer": "Results vary by business and industry, but typical outcomes include: 20-50% follower growth monthly in early months, 3-8% average engagement rate, increased website traffic, more inquiries and leads, and improved brand recognition in Oranmore. Most businesses see meaningful impact within 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you work with businesses outside Oranmore?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! While we're based in Oranmore, we serve businesses throughout East Galway, County Galway, and across Ireland. Our local expertise combines with professional social media capabilities that work for businesses anywhere."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you help if we've never used social media before?",
      "answer": "Yes! We work with many Oranmore businesses starting from scratch. We'll help you choose the right platforms, set up professional profiles, develop your brand voice, and build your social presence from the ground up with strategic guidance every step of the way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if we already have social media accounts but they're not active?",
      "answer": "Perfect! We can audit your existing accounts, refresh profiles with professional branding, develop a new content strategy, and revitalize your presence. Many of our most successful Oranmore clients came to us with dormant accounts that we transformed into thriving communities."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you handle negative comments or reviews?",
      "answer": "We monitor accounts continuously and respond to negative feedback professionally and promptly. Our goal is always to resolve issues, demonstrate excellent customer service, and turn negative situations into positive outcomes. We'll consult with you on sensitive issues before responding."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is social media marketing better than traditional advertising?",
      "answer": "They serve different purposes. Social media builds long-term brand awareness, community, and customer relationships. Traditional advertising and paid digital ads drive immediate actions. The most successful Oranmore businesses use both – and we can help with comprehensive digital strategies."
