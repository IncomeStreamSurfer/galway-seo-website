  "faq": [
    {"question": "What exactly does AI do in marketing?", "answer": "AI automates repetitive tasks, analyzes data at scale, personalizes customer experiences, predicts outcomes, optimizes campaigns in real-time, generates content, manages chatbot conversations, and more. For Oughterard businesses, this translates to better results with significantly less manual effort."},
    {"question": "How quickly can AI be implemented?", "answer": "Timeline depends on scope. Basic automation can launch within 2-3 weeks. Comprehensive AI implementations typically take 4-8 weeks. We prioritize quick wins first, then progressively add advanced capabilities to accelerate value delivery for your Oughterard business."},
    {"question": "Is AI marketing only for tech-savvy businesses?", "answer": "Not at all! We handle all technical complexity. You don't need technical expertise – we set up and manage the AI systems while training your Oughterard team on simple interfaces. You'll benefit from AI without needing to understand the underlying technology."},
    {"question": "What's the investment required for AI marketing?", "answer": "Investment varies by business size and objectives.
