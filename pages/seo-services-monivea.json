  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "How long before my Monivea business sees SEO results?",
      "answer": "SEO typically shows initial results within 2-4 months, with substantial improvements by 6-12 months. The timeline depends on your industry competition, current website status, and keyword difficulty. Unlike paid ads, SEO builds sustainable momentum - once established, organic rankings continue delivering traffic and customers to your Monivea business over time."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is SEO worth the investment for small Monivea businesses?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! SEO is one of the most cost-effective marketing strategies for small businesses. Unlike paid advertising that requires continuous spending, SEO builds long-term organic visibility. For Monivea businesses, effective SEO can level the playing field, allowing you to compete with larger companies and dominate your local market."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can you guarantee my Monivea business will rank #1?",
      "answer": "We can't ethically guarantee specific rankings as Google's algorithm involves over 200 factors that constantly evolve. However, we do guarantee our commitment to proven strategies, transparent communication, and relentless optimization focused on driving measurable traffic, leads, and revenue growth for your Monivea business."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's included in your SEO service?",
      "answer": "Our comprehensive SEO includes technical optimization, keyword research and targeting, content strategy and creation, on-page SEO, strategic link building, local SEO setup (Google Business Profile, citations), competitor analysis, monthly performance reporting, and regular strategy consultations customized for your Monivea business."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much does SEO cost for Monivea businesses?",
      "answer": "Investment varies based on your goals, competition, and timeline. Local Monivea campaigns typically start at €1,200-€2,000/month, while more competitive strategies may require €3,000-€5,000/month. We provide custom proposals after analyzing your specific situation and business objectives."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is SEO different from Google Ads?",
      "answer": "Google Ads delivers immediate traffic but requires ongoing spending - traffic stops when ads stop. SEO builds long-term organic visibility that continues generating traffic without ongoing ad costs. For most Monivea businesses, we recommend combining both - ads for immediate results while building SEO for sustainable long-term growth."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you measure SEO success?",
      "answer": "We track comprehensive metrics including keyword rankings, organic traffic growth, user engagement, conversion rates, lead generation, and revenue impact. Monthly reports provide detailed insights, segmented by location and keyword type. We focus on metrics that actually drive business growth for your Monivea company."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I've had bad experiences with SEO before?",
      "answer": "Many businesses have had poor experiences with low-quality SEO services. We take a completely different approach - proven strategies, transparent reporting, ethical practices, and continuous optimization. We'd be happy to review your past efforts and explain how our methodology differs and why it delivers results."
